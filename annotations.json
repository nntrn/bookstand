    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "How Happiness Gives Your Brain–and Your Organization–the Competitive Edge\n\nIn 1543, Nicolas Copernicus published De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolution of Celestial Spheres). Until then, most of the world had believed that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun revolved around the planet. But Copernicus famously argued that precisely the opposite was true—Earth revolved around the sun—a revelation that eventually changed the way humans saw the entire universe.\nToday, a similar fundamental shift in the field of psychology is underway. For untold generations, we have been led to believe that happiness orbited around success. That if we work hard enough, we will be successful, and only if we are successful will we become happy. Success was thought to be the fixed point of the work universe, with happiness revolving around it. Now, thanks to breakthroughs in the burgeoning field of positive psychology, we are learning that the opposite is true. When we are happy—when our mindset and mood are positive—we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it.\nUnfortunately, despite the decades of research that tell us otherwise, many businesses and their leaders still cling stubbornly to their belief in this flawed order. The ruling powers continue to tell us that if we just put our nose to the grindstone and work hard now, we will be successful, and therefore happier, in some distant future. As we work toward our goals, happiness is either irrelevant or an easily dispensable luxury or a reward only to be won after a lifetime of toil. Some even treat it as a weakness, a sign that we’re not working hard enough. Every time we fall for this misguided creed, we undercut not only our mental and emotional well-being, but also our chances at success and achievement.\nThe most successful people, the ones with the competitive edge, don’t look to happiness as some distant reward for their achievements, nor grind through their days on neutral or negative; they are the ones who capitalize on the positive and reap the rewards at every turn. This chapter will show you how they do it, why it works, and how you, too, can profit. In its own way, the Happiness Advantage, too, is a Copernican revolution—it shows us that success orbits around happiness, not the other way around.1\nDEFINING HAPPINESS\n\nNo one would talk to me. I was minutes away from speaking about the connection between happiness and performance at work to a group of executives from the Korean company Samsung, just waiting for the HR manager to introduce me to the room. I usually enjoy getting to know people during this brief interlude before a talk, but on this day all the managers were staring ahead blankly, ignoring my repeated attempts at conversation. So I dejectedly pretended to fix my PowerPoint presentation (a surefire tactic for avoiding social awkwardness in these situations, though it works less well at cocktail parties). Finally, someone entered the room and introduced himself as Brian, the leader of the group. That’s when I learned that the planners of the event had forgotten to mention one small detail: No one spoke any English.\nAs it turns out, the translator Samsung usually hired for these occasions was out sick, so Brian offered to translate for me. As we began, he leaned over and confided, “I’m not great with languages.”\nFor the next three hours, I spoke in one-minute bursts, turning after each one to my “translator,” who would proceed to either look very confused, or animatedly start speaking to the group, usually for about three minutes longer than I had. I have no idea how accurately he was translating, but I do know he got all the credit for my jokes. Given how bumpy this process was, I decided to stop talking and instead encourage the executives to talk to one another. “To study how happiness affects performance,” I said, “we need a definition. So that’s the question I pose to you: What is happiness?” Pleased with my little last-minute exercise, I waited for Brian to translate what I had just said. Instead, he looked confused and leaned toward me. “You don’t know what happiness means?” he asked nervously.\nMy face froze. “No, I’m saying I’d like the group to come up with a definition of happiness.”\nHe covered his microphone and leaned in again, clearly trying not to embarrass me. “I can Google it for you.”\nTHE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS\n\nWhile I was appreciative of the offer, not even the all-knowing Google has a definitive answer to this question. That’s because there is no single meaning; happiness is relative to the person experiencing it. This is why scientists often refer to it as “subjective well-being”—because it’s based on how we each feel about our own lives.2 In essence, the best judge of how happy you are is you. To empirically study happiness, then, scientists must rely on individual self-reports. Thankfully, after years of testing and honing survey q",

In the second, the matador and his assistants stick sharp barbs in the bull’s shoulders to wear him down. In the third act, called muerte (death), the matador kills the animal after bringing the bull to the point of physical and psychological exhaustion.\nBeing in a mimetic rivalry is like being a bull in a bullfight. In a bullfight, the matador orchestrates the actions of the bull. He makes the bull charge at a waving red cape, only to pull it away at the last second—just when the bull thinks he’s going in for the kill.9",

He grows tired of such a futile undertaking but the treasure is too precious for him to give up. So he begins to look for a stone which is too heavy to lift—he places all his hopes in that stone and he will waste all his remaining strength on it.”10 Lamborghini chose not to.",

Each reason alone was more than twice as effective as the two combined.\nThe audience was already skeptical. When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them—and they shielded themselves against it. A single line of argument feels like a conversation; multiple lines of argument can become an onslaught.",

We call the eighteenth century ‘the Enlightenment’, even though, while it may have expanded ‘the rights of man’, it ‘narrowed the rights of women, who were denied control of their property and earnings and barred from higher education and professional training’.

But for trips between neighbourhoods, i.e. the type of travel women are likely to be making for informal work or care-giving responsibilities, Uberpool took twenty-eight minutes to make a trip that took forty-seven minutes on public transport.",

They were all single-minded. They were all men. They also didn’t get laid much. ‘You would hack, and you would live by the Hacker Ethic, and you knew that horribly inefficient and wasteful things like women burned too many cycles, occupied too much memory space,’ Levy explained. ‘Women, even today, are considered grossly unpredictable,’ one of his heroes told him. ‘How can a [default male] hacker tolerate such an imperfect being?’",

She had removed her body armour because it was too difficult to use the ram while wearing it. Two years later a female police officer revealed that she had to have breast-reduction surgery because of the health effects of wearing her body armour. After this case was reported another 700 officers in the same force came forward to complain about the standard-issue protective vest.64 But although the complaints have been coming regularly over the past twenty years, little seems to have been done. British female police officers report being bruised by their kit belts; a number have had to have physiotherapy as a result of the way stab vests sit on their female body; many complain there is no space for their breasts. This is not only uncomfortable, it also results in stab vests coming up too short, leaving women unprotected. Which rather negates the whole point of wearing one.",

The truth is darker.\nThe Egyptians used their cats for ritual offerings and sacrifice. That’s why they were considered sacred. In mimetic theory, there is a near-indissoluble link between chaos and order, violence and the sacred. Sacrificial rites—whether sacrificing cats in ancient Egypt or the ritual firing of coaches and CEOs today—are the mechanism by which mimetic contagion is contained and controlled.\nThe fourth and final stage of the mimetic cycle, which we turn to now, is the process by which chaotic desires become orderly desires in human societies: the scapegoat mechanism.",

Physiologists study how the smells are carried to the sensory cells in the nose by our breathing in, as when inhaling the aroma of a cup of coffee, and by breathing out, as when we chew and swallow our food. Psychologists study how smell is combined with taste and the other senses to produce what is called taste but is really flavor, one of the most complex of human sensations. Cognitive neuroscientists use brain imaging to show how flavor arises from activity at the highest cognitive levels of our brains. Neuropharmacologists study how the regions of the brain that are activated by cravings for food involve some of the same regions that are activated by cravings for tobacco, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. Biochemists identify the hormones that circulate in the blood, connecting our bodies with our brains to signal to start eating when we are hungry and stop when we are full. Anthropologists speculate that cooked food was a major driving force in human evolution. Molecular biologists have discovered that the sensory receptors for smell form the largest gene family in the genome, and they are studying how the molecules give rise to our perceptions of different smells. And we are good smellers: behavioral psychologists find that monkeys as well as humans have much more sensitive senses of smell than previously recognized.",

Perhaps the most famous experimental example is a thirty-second film, created by University of Illinois cognitive scientist Daniel Simons, in which six basketball players—three in white T-shirts and three in black T-shirts—are seen passing a ball. The viewers are instructed to count the number of passes by the white team. Halfway through the film, a woman in a gorilla suit walks on-screen, stops in the middle of the tussle, and beats her chest repeatedly before exiting stage left. The gorilla remains on-screen for a total of nine seconds. Our intuition tells us that anyone not in a coma would notice the gorilla. But as Simons has discovered time and again, most people do not. More than half of all the subjects to whom he’s shown the film completely miss the gorilla because they are focused on the passing game",

They are, to use mathematical jargon, in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark. They seldom, if ever, have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating for a brilliant young mind to cope with the mysterious ways in which the magician’s mind works.

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "Other studies by Jeff’s team have also confirmed that, just as Bowlby predicted, secure and anxiously attached people tend to reach for those they love for comfort while avoidant people tend to withdraw. But then they discovered a wrinkle. That finding is true only when the threat comes from outside the relationship, as in the study above. When it comes from inside, the responses are different. Both secure and avoidant people can stay on topic and keep their emotions in check while discussing internal conflicts—say, the fact that one partner wants more sex than the other—although secure folks are still better at constructing solutions and acting warmly toward their partner. But in the face of internal conflict, anxious partners do not reach out; they go completely off the rails. They catastrophize, bring in irrelevant issues, and become angry and confrontational, even when their partner refrains from being reciprocally hostile. Anxious partners are generally uneasy about their lover’s commitment to begin with and thus are primed to view anything he or she says or does more negatively. Haunted by the specter of abandonment, they try to control their lover.",

On the first floor and reaching into the foundation are your basic needs for comfort, reassurance, connection, closeness, and care as well as your basic emotions, including joy, fear, sadness, and anger. These are wired in by thousands of years of evolution. On the second floor are your ways of coping with these needs and emotions, opening to and trusting them, cutting them off or defending against them, or becoming obsessed and being taken over by them. On the third floor are your attitudes and ways of thinking about relationships—what you can expect from others and what you are entitled to.

The fact that negative emotion predominates in this list speaks to the existential significance of emotion. In survival terms (as reporters know), bad news and negatives are more important.

It’s a feedback loop and includes such factors as relationship satisfaction, emotional intimacy, and previous sexual activity, all of which influence sexual response. “Women often begin sexual experiences feeling sexually neutral,” she observes, “and move into desire and arousal as a result of sexual cues from their partner. Their sexuality is often responsive rather then agentic. It is a reaction to a partner’s sexual interest.”",

For example, Spitz1 has shown that a very young child needs actual physical stroking to survive. On the other hand, adults may require only occasional, symbolic strokes such as praise, or an expression of appreciation, to remain alive. However, while it is possible to survive on minimal strokes, stroke scarcity is unhealthy both physically and emotionally; thus stroke hunger is a major driving force in people.",

Corporate boards are more likely to support paying outlandish premiums for companies after group discussions. Citizens who start out with a clear belief on affirmative action and gay marriage develop more extreme views on these issues after talking with a few others who share their stance. Their preaching and prosecuting move in the direction of their politics. Polarization is reinforced by conformity: peripheral members fit in and gain status by following the lead of the most prototypical member of the group, who often holds the most intense views.",

But time and again, their flaws sabotage them, blocking them from gaining what they want both on a conscious and subconscious level. It’s ironic, really; who they are and what they want are often at odds, making it difficult for them to achieve success",

When we stonewall, the most extreme version of dismissal and nonresponsiveness, we mostly do so in order to cut off our emotions; we freeze and retreat into numbness.

Most times, an affair is an indication of a more profound problem. If you are dancing close and in tune with your partner, there is no place for a third dancer to enter. Often, the bond has begun to erode or failed to firm into a secure connection; frequently there have been preceding cycles of criticizing and distancing. But the partners have been unsure what that meant, let alone what to do about it. So they have been accepting the relationship as it is and accommodating to the lack of connection. Then suddenly the “My partner has turned to someone else and is having an affair” bomb detonates, and the relationship becomes obviously and overwhelmingly distressed.",

For instance, if I were to flash the word “departure” on a computer screen, you would later say the word “depart” slightly faster when confronted with it. The presentation of “departure” seems to preactivate the morpheme [depart], thus facilitating its access. Psychologists speak of a “priming” effect—the reading of a word primes the recognition of related words, much as one primes a pump. Importantly, this priming effect does not depend solely on visual similarity: words that look quite different but share a morpheme, such as “can” and “could,” can prime each other, whereas words that look alike but bear no intimate morphological relation, such as “aspire” and “aspirin,” do not",

He describes hostile and erotic impulses to people who actually exhibit minimal signs of a corresponding unconscious impulse. Since everyone has hostile impulses … it is not difficult for the selectively hypersensitive paranoid to find persons on whom to project. Thus there is always a core of truth in paranoid accusations.” Here Cameron, in typically convoluted psychiatric jargon, states (only to let it pass) the most important fact about paranoia: namely, stated in my words, that paranoia is a state of heightened awareness",

The test, described in detail by Richard Wiseman, a psychologist and famed skeptic, is a way to gauge your “self-monitoring” tendency. If you drew the letter with the tail to the left, so that others could read it, you are a high self-monitor. That means you are more concerned with appearance and perception—how others see you.

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "Since time immemorial, people have cooked food in boiling water, essentially because it’s easy to do. But Rumford had always wondered whether this was the ideal temperature for cooking. One day he decided to see what would happen if he placed a piece of mutton in his potato drying machine. Would the taste be different if the meat were cooked at this lower temperature? He checked on the mutton three hours later and saw that it showed no signs of being done and concluded that the heat was not sufficiently intense. He abandoned the experiment, telling the maids to cook the mutton properly. Apparently they forgot about the meat until the next morning and when they checked on it, they discovered that it had been perfectly cooked despite the fact that the fire that had supplied the heat had gone out during the night. Rumford was delighted and the concept of slow cooking at low temperature was born. The sous-vide method, currently championed by many chefs can be traced back to this fortuitous discovery made by Count Rumford.",

Starting with the most basic, the calorie count on treadmills is perfect for practically no one, but it will be more accurate for your average man because its calculations are based on the average male weight (the default setting for calorie count on most exercise machines is for a person who weighs eleven stone). And although you can change the weight setting, that still leaves a calculation based on an average male calorie burn. Women generally have a higher fat and lower muscle distribution than men as well as different ratios of various muscle fibres. What this means at a basic level is that even after accounting for weight difference, men on average will burn 8% more calories than a woman of the same weight. The treadmill does not account for this.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "One of the peculiar features of history is that time always erodes advantage. Every invention sooner or later leads to a counterinvention. Every success contains the seeds of its own overthrow. Every hegemony comes to an end. Evolutionary history is no different. Progress and success are always relative. When the land was unoccupied by animals, the first amphibian to emerge from the sea could get away with being slow, lumbering, and fishlike, for it had no enemies and no competitors. But if a fish were to take to the land today, it would be gobbled up by a passing fox as surely as a Mongol horde would be wiped out by machine guns. In history and in evolution, progress is always a futile, Sisyphean struggle to stay in the same relative place by getting ever better at things. Cars move through the congested streets of London no faster than horse-drawn carriages did a century ago. Computers have no effect on productivity because people learn to complicate and repeat tasks that have been made easier.13\nThis concept, that all progress is relative, has come to be known in biology by the name of the Red Queen, after a chess piece that Alice meets in Through the Looking-Glass, who perpetually runs without getting very far because the landscape moves with her. It is an increasingly influential idea in evolutionary theory, and one that will recur throughout the book. The faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progress. Life is a chess tournament in which if you win a game, you start the next game with the handicap of a missing pawn.",

Once he commits himself to his course of action, he does not expect to come out of it alive.

In fact, any countable number of moments will still total up to zero seconds.",

Gradually this Zeus displaced the others, until he occupied the whole scene. At last he became, in the words of Dio Chrysostom, who wrote during the second century A.D.: “Our Zeus, the giver of every good gift, the common father and saviour and guardian of mankind.”",

For example, in this scene Joe is in love with Lorna, but the essential action is getting her to take the chance. By concentrating on getting her to do something, and not on trying to be in love for the duration of the scene, the actor will find himself in the world of the concretely doable, not in the nebulous world of feelings outside the actor’s control. The essential action, then, is what exists in the scene when you eliminate all ideas about what you think the author is saying the character feels at any given moment in favor of what he is trying to accomplish. The idea of Lorna dumping Moody for Joe involves all the emotional aspects of a romantic triangle, but what is essential as an end result is one person trying to get another person to take a chance.",

This message is inaccurate and thus will cost the Imperfects a point in the end. But it may have the compensatory effect of keeping more of the Imperfects on the telephone for more of the time, thus increasing the total number of accurate messages they transmit. Under the right circumstances, the costs of this inaccurate belief would be outweighed by its benefits, namely, that it led players to behave in ways that increased the odds that they would share other accurate beliefs. The lesson to be learned from this game is that inaccurate beliefs can prevail in the belief-transmission game if they somehow facilitate their own “means of transmission.” In this case, the means of transmission is not sex but communication, and thus any belief—even a false belief—that increases communication has a good chance of being transmitted over and over again",

The world is full of people who want happiness and don’t care one bit about whether it is “well deserved.” Second, those who claim that they would not agree to be hooked up may already be hooked up. After all, the deal is that you forget your previous decision. Third, no one can really answer this question because it requires them to imagine a future state in which they do not know the very thing they are currently contemplating. See E. B. Royzman, K. W.

The Coolidge effect ostensibly got its name when President Calvin Coolidge and his wife were touring a farm. The foreman noted the sexual prowess of his prize rooster: “This rooster can have sex all day without stopping,” he said. “Really?” said Mrs. Coolidge. “Please tell that to my husband.” The president turned to the foreman and asked, “Does the rooster mate with the same chicken each time?” “No,” said the foreman, “always with a different chicken.” To which the president replied, “Really? Please tell that to my wife.” The story is probably apocryphal, but the phenomenon is not: Male mammals who have mated to exhaustion can usually be induced to mate again with a novel female; see J. Wilson, R. Kuehn, and F. Beach, “Modifications in the Sexual Behavior of Male Rats Produced by Changing the Stimulus Female,” Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology 56: 636–44 (1963). In fact, even breeding bulls whose sperm is collected by a machine show a greatly reduced time to ejaculation when the machine to which they’ve become habituated is moved to a novel location. E. B.

The point here is that time and variety are two ways to avoid habituation, and if you have one, then you don’t need the other.

They were a beautiful, radiant company, to be sure, and their adventures made excellent stories; but when they were not positively harmful, they were capricious and undependable, and in general mortals got on best without them.",

Former track star Phil Knight started selling running shoes out of the trunk of his car in 1964, yet kept working as an accountant until 1969. After inventing the original Apple I computer, Steve Wozniak started the company with Steve Jobs in 1976 but continued working full time in his engineering job at Hewlett-Packard until 1977. And although Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin figured out how to dramatically improve internet searches in 1996, they didn’t go on leave from their graduate studies at Stanford until 1998. “We almost didn’t start Google,” Page says, because we “were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program.”",

Each outcome confirmed he was right, no matter how equivocal the evidence might look to someone less wise than the master. “All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time, except those whom it does not help, who all die,” he wrote. “It is obvious, therefore, that it fails only in incurable cases.”5\nGalen is an extreme example but he is the sort of figure who pops up repeatedly in the history of medicine.

His test subjects were “split-brain” patients, meaning that the left and right hemispheres of their brains could not communicate with each other because the connection between them, the corpus callosum, had been surgically severed (traditionally as a treatment for severe epilepsy). These people are remarkably normal, but their condition allows researchers to communicate directly with only one hemisphere of their brain—by showing an image to only the left or right field of vision—without sharing the communication with the other hemisphere. It’s like talking to two different people. In this case, the left field of vision (which reports to the right hemisphere) was shown a picture of a snowstorm and the person was asked to point to the picture that related to it. So he quite reasonably pointed at the shovel. The right field of vision (which reports to the left hemisphere) was shown an image of a chicken claw—and the person was then asked why his hand was pointed at a shovel. The left hemisphere had no idea why. But the person didn’t say “I don’t know.” Instead, he made up a story: “Oh, that’s simple,” one patient said. “The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.”15",

His superfast reading speed, various professional roles, constant podcasting and networking, obsessive learning, perpetual travel, and sheer stamina enable him to take in many more and different inputs, which allows him to have many more and different outputs. But it’s what’s in between where he shines. He sees the world as an economist, philosopher, psychologist, sociologist, anthropologist, liberal and conservative, globalist and nationalist, foreigner and native, art critic and artist, employer/administrator and employee, grant provider and grant recipient, interviewer and interviewee, teacher and student. There is almost no one who views the world like Tyler because almost no one has a comparable number or variety of inputs or mental models. Even if his conclusions were conventional, his reasoning and perspectives wouldn’t be.”",

He told himself not to flinch if the snake tried to strike. After all, the snake was behind glass! His fear was purely psychological. But he failed again and again. “As soon as the blow was struck my resolution went to nothing and I jumped a yard or two backwards with astonishing rapidity,” he wrote in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. “Will and reason were powerless.” Telling ourselves not to feel fear is like telling ourselves not to blink when we sneeze. Our bodies know what they know, and trying to fight that programming is a waste of time. What really matters most is how we use our conscious minds to handle that knowledge.",

As he told the crew in a 1980 speech: “We are beholden to no army of outside sales staff. Rather, we depend on the investor to come directly to us.” And they did. By waiting for people to come to it, Vanguard ended up attracting the best kind of “sticky” investors. In Character Counts, Bogle comments:\n\nWe have always known that our typical Vanguard client is better educated and wealthier than the typical fund investor. We know that, in addition, he or she is more ready, willing, and able to move his or her assets among our funds. In short, our prototypical client is a financially astute investor who knows what he or she wants, when he or she wants it and how to get it.",

A psychologist and former president of the American Psychology Association, Seligman was responsible for defining the term “PERMA,” the root of many positive psychology research projects around the world. The acronym stands for the five elements essential to lasting contentment:\n\nPositive emotion: Peace, gratitude, satisfaction, pleasure, inspiration, hope, curiosity, and love fall into this category.\nEngagement: Losing ourselves in a task or project provides us with a sense of “disappeared time” because we are so highly engaged.\nRelationships: People who have meaningful, positive relationships with others are happier than those who do not.\nMeaning: Meaning comes from serving a cause bigger than ourselves. Whether it’s a religion or a cause that helps humanity in some way, we all need meaning in our lives.\nAccomplishment/achievement: To feel significant life satisfaction, we must strive to better ourselves",

It’s not a game of Parcheesi, with every move geared toward victory; rather, it’s a game of make-believe, a game of “yes, and…,” a game passed from generation to generation, a torch that never goes dark. “A finite game is played for the purpose of winning,” wrote James Carse, “an infinite game for the purpose of continuing to play.”",

If you were to refuse to conform, there could be trouble. You could be isolated, alienated, reproached for being idealistic, or scorned for not being a team player. You know what it is you are supposed to do, and you do it, not least to show that you’re doing it. You go along to get along, he said, and so you confirm to others that certain things in fact must be done if you are to get along in life. If you fail to act as you’re expected to, others will view your behavior as abnormal, think you arrogant for believing you’re above the rules, or assume you’ve dropped out of society. The society grown rigid with ideology gives you and everyone else the illusion that the way things are is the way things are meant to be; the story you hear is natural. It has been told and retold for years. Everyone tells it.3",

He\n\t\t\t\t\tthen started to apply his theories to the whole cosmos, demonstrating the\n\t\t\t\t\tharmonic relationship of the stars, planets, and elements. His idea of harmonic\n\t\t\t\t\trelationships between the stars was eagerly taken up by medieval and Renaissance\n\t\t\t\t\tastronomers, who developed whole theories around the idea of the music of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspheres, and his suggestion that the elements were arranged harmoniously was\n\t\t\t\t\trevisited over 2,000 years after his death. In 1865 English chemist John\n\t\t\t\t\tNewlands discovered that when the chemical elements are arranged according to\n\t\t\t\t\tatomic weight, those with similar properties occur at every eighth element, like\n\t\t\t\t\tnotes of music.

As I see it, there are three.\nTo the first count of not calling you back, you are right, absolutely right. It is rude. It is not how a friend, or even a solid citizen, behaves. I should know better. It sends an unfortunate and incorrect message that I don’t care about you. (If it makes you feel better, I am democratic about this particular failing. I don’t call back my mother, my brother, and my in-laws. My wife says, “Me too.” This is hardly something to brag about—just a minuscule point of honor on my part to assure you that you are not in the bottom half of some imaginary call-back priority list. Apparently, I don’t have one. I treat everyone equally—which is to say, rudely.) For this I apologize to you. And I will change that.\nTo the second count of being a poor host when you were at my house, I certainly did not intend to ignore you or leave you out of the conversation. That said, what I remember is not the point. It’s what you felt that matters, and this is especially pertinent when the issue is hospitality extended or withheld. As Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach used to say about coaching his players, “It’s not what you say, it’s what they hear.” You obviously didn’t enjoy the evening, and for that I apologize. I like to think of myself as a decent and caring and generous host, and I will take your comments as a signal to do better.\nTo the third count of my never initiating a phone call to friends, again you are right, absolutely right. Some people, as you say, like to work at friendship. Others don’t.\nOf all the charges you level at me, the third is the one that pains me most—because it is true and because it is so easily fixed. You are not the first to point this out. I guess I could wander back into my childhood to figure out why I act this way, but looking backward, seeking out scapegoats, is a fool’s errand. I’m 52 years old. I can’t blame my mother or my upbringing or that lousy tuna sandwich in third grade. All I can do is promise to fix my behavior, one step at a time—by taking my cues from you, by doing the things you say a good friend does. Hopefully, my rehabilitation starts with you.\nThe evidence notwithstanding, I do value our friendship. Tremendously. We have too many years of laughs and good times and neighboring and genuine caring for each other to let our friendship slip away because I am a schmuck in an area where you least value that kind of behavior. All I can ask is your forgiveness. If you can grant me that, I do not expect us to return to things the way they were. I think we should aim higher. I would want us to return to things as they should be, where I can aspire to the ideal of friendship that you have described in your honest, painfully honest, letter to me.\nShall we discuss this over a bottle of red?",

In fact, I calculate that you have to get 100% better in order to get 10% credit for it from your coworkers.”\nThe logic behind this is, as I’ve explained in Chapter 3, cognitive dissonance: To recap, we view people in a manner that is consistent with our previous existing stereotypes, whether it is positive or negative. If I think you’re an arrogant jerk, everything you do will be filtered through that perception. If you do something wonderful and saintly, I will regard it as the exception to the rule; you’re still an arrogant jerk. Within that framework it’s almost impossible for us to be perceived as improving, no matter how hard we try.\nHowever, the odds improve considerably if you tell people that you are trying to change. Suddenly, your efforts are on their radar screen. You’re beginning to chip away at their preconceptions.\nYour odds improve again if you tell everyone how hard you’re trying, and repeat the message week after week.\nYour odds improve even more if you ask everyone for ideas to help you get better. Now your coworkers become invested in you; they pay attention to you to see if you’re paying attention to their suggestions.\nEventually the message sinks in and people start to accept the possibility of a new improved you. It’s a little like the tree falling in the forest. If no one hears the thud, does it make a sound? The apology and the announcement that you’re trying to change are your way of pointing everyone in the direction of the tree.\n",

But there are three more phases before you get to the seventh, implementation.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people don’t pay close attention to phases four, five, and six—the vital period when you approach your coworkers to secure the all-important political buy-in to your plans. In each phase you must target a different constituency. In phase 4, you woo up—to get your superiors to approve. In phase 5, you woo laterally—to get your peers to agree. In phase 6, you woo down—to get your direct reports to accept. These three phases are the sine qua non of getting things done. You cannot skip or skim over them. You have to give them as much, if not more, attention, as you do phases one, two, three, and seven. If you don’t, you may as well be working alone in a locked room where no one sees you, hears you, or knows you exist. That’s the guaranteed result of committing “one, two, three, seven.”",

Like a politician making headlines for introducing new legislation, if you have a new initiative at work, you have to do something dramatic to announce it. (Reagan taught us that.) For sheer drama, apologizing fits the bill. What could be more theatrical than telling people that you’re sorry for some transgression and you’ll try to do better in the future, especially people who think you cannot change?\nDon’t stop there. You can’t just apologize and say you’re trying to do better just once. You have to drill it into people repeatedly, until they’ve internalized the concept.\nIt’s the reason politicians in a hard election campaign run the same ads over and over again.

It grew out of a discussion I had with Jon Katzenbach in the early 1990s. We were frustrated with the limitations of the usual corporate feedback mechanisms to find out areas of improvement in an organization, such as the questionnaires that forced people to relive the past over and over again—the discussions among colleagues that descended into nightmarish arguments about who did what to whom way back when. As I hope I made clear in my brief history of feedback in Chapter 6, feedback has its virtues. It’s a great tool for determining what happened in the past and what’s going on in an organization. It’s no different than reading history, which teaches us how we all arrived here right now in this moment.

Just as there are words that are best left unspoken, so there are feelings that are best left unthought.* The theory is that if all our unconscious motivations were to impinge on our consciousness, subtle cues in our behaviour might reveal our true motivation, which would limit our social and reproductive prospects.\nRobert Trivers gives an extraordinary example of a case where an animal having conscious access to its own actions may be damaging to its evolutionary fitness. When a hare is being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random and not conscious, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer.",

To keep the wolf from the door has meant to keep out hunger or ward off starvation since at least the 15th century and was a well-known proverb by the time John Heywood included it in his collection.

A nervous, inexperienced hunter is said to have buck fever, a term also transferred to any nervous anticipation of a new experience; it originated in America in the 1830s. Buckshot, a large size of lead shot used in hunting game, dates from the early days of firearms and has been so called since about 1400. One writer suggests it gave rise to pass the buck -- that is, to shift responsibility or blame someone else -- from a counter consisting of a piece of buckshot put in front of the dealer in a poker game and passing it on to the next person who was to deal. Another source suggests the object so passed originally was a buckhorn, a type of knife so named because its handle was made from a buck's antlers. Whichever is true, the term originated in the United States in the latter half of the 19th century and was made famous after 1949 by President Harry S Truman, who kept a sign on his desk in the White House that said, \"The buck stops here\" (that is, I'll take full responsibility).",

From this came, in the 16th century or even earlier, bearskin jobber, a broker who gambled on his belief that the market would fall (prices would drop) and behaved accordingly (sold his holdings while he could still get a high price). This term was easily shortened to bear. The bear's counterpart, the bull, believes prices are going to rise and therefore buys while they are still low. The source for this kind of bull is less clear. Some believe it comes from the bull's tossing objects up with his horns; others believe that bull-baiting was more or less a companion sport to bear-baiting. Whichever the case, both the concept and the terms have stuck, and we still speak of a bullish or bearish investor, described as optimistic or pessimistic respectively, and a bull market or bear market, depending on which type of investor prevails.",

In one, the nightingale (or sparrow, depending on the translation) tries to talk its captor, the hawk, into letting it go, since it is but a small morsel, and to search for bigger prey. But the hawk knows better. In another, a fisherman catches an anchovy that argues along the same lines as the nightingale. The proverb originated in Greek, was repeated in Latin -- it appeared in Britain in Latin Medieval Proverbs (c. 1400) as a rhymed verse -- and by 1450 or so had an English version. Today it is often put: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Similar sayings appear in Italian (better an egg today than a chicken tomorrow), German (one bird in the hand is better than ten flying over the land), French (better a sparrow than a goose in the air), Spanish (a bird in the hand is better than a hundred flying), and other languages.",

Most people hate confrontation and seek ways to avoid it. And we know what happens when problems aren’t dealt with: they fester, and complications multiply, making things even harder to fix. \nThe act of avoidance itself can generate conflict as the character goes to great lengths to keep from facing the issue. This technique gets high points for both authenticity and its tendency to create more problems, so if avoidance fits your character’s personality, be sure to take advantage of it.",

The adult’s intention was clear: he wanted to pull the toy apart. But apparently he failed.\nAfter the adult’s performance, the researcher presented the object to the infants and observed what they did. The babies would pick up the dumbbell and immediately pull it apart—forty out of the fifty times the experiment was conducted. They didn’t mimic what the adults did; they imitated what they thought the adults wanted to do. They read beneath the surface behavior.9\nThe babies in the experiment were pre-linguistic.

The problem is known as ‘information asymmetry’, whereby the seller knows more about what he is selling than the buyer knows about what he is buying. This lesson was learned the hard way in Eastern Bloc countries under communism; brands were considered un-Marxist, so bread was simply labelled ‘bread’. Customers had no idea who had made it or whom to blame if it arrived full of maggots, and couldn’t avoid that make in future if it did, because all bread packaging looked the same. Unhappy customers had no threat of sanction; happy customers had no prospect of rewarding producers through repeat custom. And so the bread was rubbish.",

Science doesn’t tackle “why” questions about the purpose of life. It sticks to “how” questions that focus on causation and probabilities. ",

Indeed, instead of being seen as the victim, she was considered by many to have been the instigator.

His spirit has been so crushed by the prison system that he angrily declares to Andy, “Hope is a dangerous thing. Drives a man insane. It’s got no place here. Better get used to the idea.” And it is Red’s emotional journey that leads him to the understanding that “hope is a good thing.” The film ends on a note of hope, with Red breaking his parole and riding the bus to meet Andy in Mexico: “I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams….I hope.”",

She even bridged the starkest opposition of all, the bitter Newton/Leibniz feud, which was still radioactive when she set out to write. As no one else had, Agnesi managed to unify the Englishman’s “fluxions” with the German’s “differences,” achieving such a perfect fusion that one Cambridge mathematics professor learned Italian expressly so that he could translate her masterwork into English.",

You can plan only one move at a time. You can’t see two or three moves above you or how you’re going to get there. Only when you reach the top of the mountain can you look down and gain some kind of an overview of the landscape you’ve negotiated.",

I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was finally done.\nThe third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would look when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that, unless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there.\nIn other words, I realized that for IBM to become a great company it would have to act like a great company long before it ever became one.",

It is about the relation of words to emotions: the way in which words don’t just point to things but are saturated with feelings, which can endow the words with a sense of magic, taboo, and sin.

The way out of this dilemma is to couch your request as a stupid question (“Can you . . . ?”), a pointless rumination (“I was wondering if . . .”), a gross overstatement (“It would be great if you could . . .”), or some other blather that is so incongruous the hearer can’t take it at face value.

These conceptions vary in their details from language to language, but their overall logic is the same. They add up to a distinctively human model of reality, which differs in major ways from the objective understanding of reality eked out by our best science and logic. Though these ideas are woven into language, their roots are deeper than language itself. They lay out the ground rules for how we understand our surroundings, how we assign credit and blame to our fellows, and how we negotiate our relationships with them.

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "In The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins explains how sexual selection can produce flamboyant displays like the outsize tail of a widowbird. Traits in males that are attractive to females can vary wildly over the course of evolution, Dawkins notes, because there are many stable combinations of a tail length preferred by females and an actual tail length in the population (which is itself a compromise between the length preferred by previous generations of choosy females and the length that is optimal for flight). Mathematicians call this “a line of equilibria,” and to establish the conditions that produce it they require abstruse equations. But Dawkins explains the idea as follows:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuppose that a room has both a heating device and a cooling device, each with its own thermostat. Both thermostats are set to keep the room at the same fixed temperature, 70 degrees F. If the temperature drops below 70, the heater turns itself on and the refrigerator turns itself off. If the temperature rises above 70, the refrigerator turns itself on and the heater turns itself off. The analogue of the widow bird’s tail length is not the temperature (which remains constant at 70°) but the total rate of consumption of electricity. The point is that there are lots of different ways in which the desired temperature can be achieved. It can be achieved by both devices working very hard, the heater belting out hot air and the refrigerator working flat out to neutralize the heat. Or it can be achieved by the heater putting out a bit less heat, and the cooler working correspondingly less hard to neutralize it. Or it can be achieved by both devices working scarcely at all. Obviously, the latter is the more desirable solution from the point of view of the electricity bill but, as far as the object of maintaining the fixed temperature is concerned, every one of a large series of working rates is equally satisfactory . We have a line of equilibrium points, rather than a single point.45",

In sharp contrast to the normal “A” chromosomes that are familiar to us, B chromosomes are smaller and can be common, and they can be found in varying numbers within a cell (fig. 1.2). What makes them stand out is their ability to tag along without doing any work. In other words, they are passed on, generation after generation, by hitchhiking without contributing to cell functionality, akin to party crashers living on free food while enjoying themselves at their host’s expense.",

He gave an example of a woman who seemed desperate to learn to dance. The problem was that her husband hated going out, so her social life was restricted. She enrolled in dancing classes, but found that she was terribly afraid of dancing in public and dropped out. Berne’s point was that what we blame the other partner for is more often revealed as an issue within ourselves. Playing “If it weren’t for you” allows us to divest ourselves of responsibility for facing our fears or shortcomings.",

A speaker begins a story with a somewhat unbelievable statement but immediately adds Now I’ll show you why that’s so. He then proceeds to support the first statement with a second apparently untrue sentence, which he bolsters by I know that sounds peculiar also, but I’ll tell you why it’s true. He keeps piling exaggeration upon exaggeration until his final sentence, in which he disowns his very first sentence either by wild hyperbole or by saying I wasn’t exactly accurate the way I began this story.",

I am likely to reply Fine, thanks, and yourself?—even though I might at that moment be suffering from flu, be hurrying to the drugstore to get my prescriptions refilled, and not be the least interested in how the person who greeted me is. But my Fine, thanks, and yourself? should not really be considered a lie. It is simply one of the stereotyped gambits offered me in my speech community’s greeting ritual. By selecting this gambit, I have not actually lied but rather have chosen a strategy whereby I can suppress further conversation about my health, with the result that I can continue on my way to the drugstore. If I had not chosen the gambit of the trivial lie but instead had replied truthfully I have a fever and headache and cough and my legs feel like they’re ready to collapse, I would have chosen a very poor option from the array of those open to me in the greeting interaction. Rather than suppressing further conversation, this option demands that the person who greeted me reply by expressing words of sympathy, whether or not he feels such an emotion: Gee, Mister Farb, I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Because as a native member of my speech community I unconsciously knew that he would have to express sympathy—and that I, further, would have to respond to it by continuing the conversation—I suppressed further interaction simply by replying to his initial greeting with the trivial lie Fine, thanks.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "The Vietnam War—not a war according to the Pentagon but an international armed conflict—inspired lying at a national level rarely seen before in history. The predominant strategy was the ornate euphemism—an effort to divert attention from the true horrors of death and destruction by labeling something the opposite of what it truly was. An aggressive attack by an armada of airplanes, which most speakers of English call simply an air raid, was instead spoken of as a momentary defensive strategy, a routine limited duration protective reaction. Defoliation of an entire forest, with the result that it may not sprout another green leaf for decades or even hundreds of years, was labeled a resources control program. The thirty-four dollars given to families of South Vietnamese civilians killed by mistake were called condolence awards, and bombing errors against friendly villages were termed navigation misdirection. Starving and homeless Vietnamese, fleeing from the horrors of war, did not seek survival in a refugee camp but instead discovered freshening experiences in what the Pentagon dubbed a new life hamlet or an Open Arms camp. A further strategy was the creation of a whole new set of “before” and “after” terms which bestowed tremendous dignity upon minor military objectives, but only after they had been destroyed. What before had been simply a straw-thatched hut became, after its bombardment, a structure. A sunken one-man dugout was elevated to a vessel, and a splintered set of logs thrown across a stream became a bridge; a gimcrack bomb-shelter, once destroyed, was referred to as a bunker or a network of tunnels.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "Closely related to the unequal treatment of a minority language by a majority language is the unequal treatment many languages give to the two sexes. The Bible regards Eve as merely an offshoot from Adam’s rib—and English follows suit by the use of many Adam’s-rib words. The scientific name for both sexes of our species is the word for only one of them, Homo, “man” in Latin; our species is also referred to as human (derived from Homo) or mankind, two other words which similarly serve to make women invisible. The average person is always masculine (as in the man in the street) and so is the hypothetical person in riddles and in examination questions (If a man can walk ten miles in seven minutes, how many miles can he walk in twelve minutes?). The word he is often used as a common-gender pronoun, even though it is possible that a female is being referred to (as in When the vice-president of the company came to town, he…). If the antecedent is a high-prestige occupational role—such as vice-president, manager, doctor, director, and so forth—then the pronoun is very likely to be he, whereas if the antecedent is a secretary, nurse, or elementary-school teacher, the pronoun is apt to be she. In discussions among college faculty (usually a “he” word), students who cheat are often referred to as he and students who do not as she. The English language is riddled with other examples of conceptual categories which apply to one sex or the other. Males roar, bellow, and growl; females squeal, shriek, and purr",

Part of the reason for this is that the irises adjust for light level and help to make differently lit environments accessible for neural processing. In low light, your irises open to allow in more photons, and in high light your irises close to keep your retina from becoming blinded by glare. That’s why a light level expert such as a photographer must use an objective light level measuring device called a photometer, rather than her own subjective visual estimates of light level, before she can determine the best f-stop to use with her camera lens.",

The inability to set aside something that you know but that someone else does not know is such a pervasive affliction of the human mind that psychologists keep discovering related versions of it and giving it new names. There is egocentrism, the inability of children to imagine a simple scene, such as three toy mountains on a tabletop, from another person’s vantage point.4 There’s hindsight bias, the tendency of people to think that an outcome they happen to know, such as the confirmation of a disease diagnosis or the outcome of a war, should have been obvious to someone who had to make a prediction about it before the fact.5 There’s false consensus, in which people who make a touchy personal decision (like agreeing to help an experimenter by wearing a sandwich board around campus with the word REPENT) assume that everyone else would make the same decision.6 There’s illusory transparency, in which observers who privately know the backstory to a conversation and thus can tell that a speaker is being sarcastic assume that the speaker’s naïve listeners can somehow detect the sarcasm, too.7 And there’s mindblindness, a failure to mentalize, or a lack of a theory of mind, in which a three-year-old who sees a toy being hidden while a second child is out of the room assumes that the other child will look for it in its actual location rather than where she last saw it.",

For us to conclude that something is not the case, we must take the extra cognitive step of pinning the mental tag “false” on a proposition.

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "Style still matters, for at least three reasons. First, it ensures that writers will get their messages across, sparing readers from squandering their precious moments on earth deciphering opaque prose. When the effort fails, the result can be calamitous—as Strunk and White put it, “death on the highway caused by a badly worded road sign, heartbreak among lovers caused by a misplaced phrase in a well-intentioned letter, anguish of a traveler expecting to be met at a railroad station and not being met because of a slipshod telegram.” Governments and corporations have found that small improvements in clarity can prevent vast amounts of error, frustration, and waste,9 and many countries have recently made clear language the law of the land.10\n\t\t\tSecond, style earns trust. If readers can see that a writer cares about consistency and accuracy in her prose, they will be reassured that the writer cares about those virtues in conduct they cannot see as easily. Here is how one technology executive explains why he rejects job applications filled with errors of grammar and punctuation: “If it takes someone more than 20 years to notice how to properly use it’s, then that’s not a learning curve I’m comfortable with.”11 And if that isn’t enough to get you to brush up your prose, consider the discovery of the dating site OkCupid that sloppy grammar and spelling in a profile are “huge turn-offs.” As one client said, “If you’re trying to date a woman, I don’t expect flowery Jane Austen prose. But aren’t you trying to put your best foot forward?”12\n\t\t\tStyle, not least, adds beauty to the world. To a literate reader, a crisp sentence, an arresting metaphor, a witty aside, an elegant turn of phrase are among life’s greatest pleasures. And as we shall see in the first chapter, this thoroughly impractical virtue of good writing is where the practical effort of mastering good writing must begin",

Even worse, a sentence can have more negations than you think it does. Not all negation words begin with n; many have the concept of negation tucked inside them, such as few, little, least, seldom, though, rarely, instead, doubt, deny, refute, avoid, and ignore.21",

Still, the tech world seems determined to clean their plates. Starting in 2019, for example, Google began adding “Order Online” buttons to restaurant listings. It should have been an added convenience for everyone involved, but Google deliberately cut the restaurants out, partnering with companies like GrubHub, DoorDash, and Postmates to bypass individual, restaurant-owned delivery platforms. It’s been incredibly lucrative for Google, which gets a reported 10 percent cut of orders placed through the button, and incredibly frustrating for restaurant owners, who say there’s no easy way to opt out of a cut-rate service they never even signed up for. The affected restaurants can either sit back and watch up to 40 percent of their profits get eaten up in delivery platform fees or essentially stop offering takeout altogether. Even if they’re still offering to-go meals, the sad truth is that they might as well not exist if they’re not indexed on Google. And that’s if they even can get themselves delisted—once Google assigns an “Order Now” button, it washes its hands of responsibility and directs restaurant complaints to the delivery platforms instead.",

We’ve known about this problem for a while, though that doesn’t seem to have helped us resist it any. In a series of experiments conducted in the 1950s by the psychologist Solomon Asch, subjects confirmed time and time again that all it takes to convince us to think something is a sense that everyone else thinks it. In one experiment, for example, he showed subjects a series of three lines and asked them to identify the one that matched the length of a fourth line. His subjects had no problem picking out the correct line—until they were put in a room of actors who deliberately chose one of the incorrect answers. About 75 percent of the subjects chose the obviously incorrect line at least once, all thanks to peer pressure. And the pressure gets worse when the liars are our friends or people we’d like to be friends with.",

Because although most of us have been taught that emotion shrouds reason, muddling thought, and leading to impulsive, illogical decisions, neuroscience has shown that the opposite is true: Emotion is what determines every decision we make—and that’s a good thing. Emotion evolved to let us know, in a nanosecond, what’s safe, what isn’t, and what matters to us, and in so doing, emotion is what ensured our survival.",

Elliot was a successful guy: he had a great job, a loving family, and he was a role model at work and at home. Unfortunately, Elliot also had a brain tumor. Tests revealed that, thankfully, it was benign, and a team of skilled surgeons were able to remove every smidge of it, but not before it had damaged some of his frontal lobe tissue, which was also removed. He recovered from the operation, and on the outside appeared to be hale and hearty. But on the inside, Elliot was no longer himself.\n\t\t\tHis life began to fall apart. He lost his job and his family, he embarked on questionable endeavors that made no sense and ended disastrously, he lost what money he had to con men, and he was finally taken in by his parents.\n\t\t\tWhat happened? Was it a previously undetected failure of moral character? Was he just lazy? That’s what several professionals thought, and so his disability benefits were cut off.\n\t\t\tThat’s when Damasio was brought in to answer the question: was Elliot’s behavior willful, or was it part of an underlying medical condition? Damasio ran a large battery of tests, and what he ultimately discovered was that Elliot had lost the ability to feel emotion. His “objective” knowledge, however, had not suffered at all.\n\t\t\tHe still tested in the ninety-seventh percentile in intelligence. He could enumerate, in great detail, every possible solution to any problem you could pitch at him. He just couldn’t pick one. He’d go into his office and wonder, should I do that thing my boss really wants me to do, or should I reorganize my file folders again today? And if so, would it be better to use the blue pen or the black pen? At lunch he’d go from restaurant to restaurant looking at menus, but he never went in, because he didn’t know what he felt like eating. Turned out even his extreme analytical intelligence didn’t do him a bit of good when it came down to making the simplest—and most basic—decision: what to have for lunch.",

Story translates facts into experience, making them concrete, giving us contextual understanding of their meaning.

While at first those two sound like the same thing, they are not. Fitting in implies we’re hiding who we really are; belonging is being accepted for being ourselves. The two are mutually exclusive. Often we struggle to fit in, when what we really want is to belong, to be seen and valued for who we really are.\n\t\t\tThat’s why we evaluate everything based on the question: “What does this say about me?” Hence it bears repeating that the real question the audience asks themselves isn’t, “Is this a good idea, cause, product, or service in and of itself?” Rather, their unspoken question is, “How could this help me and how could it hurt me in terms of how others see me, and how I see myself?”",

But harvesting is only one of the challenges faced by sea turtles today. Another, more subtle threat also looms—that of warming temperatures. Sea turtles plan their reproductive cycle to coincide with just the right temperature window within which to lay their eggs. This is because the temperature of the sand determines the sex of the hatchling. It’s as if instead of X and Y chromosomes, our sex was dictated by the weather.

Diane Cowan, senior scientist at The Lobster Conservancy and a former student of Atema’s, explains that for females, this part-time moving-in together is a test. The female learns whether the male really controls the shelter or if another male can come kick him out. More than anything, a female lobster needs to know her partner can offer her total protection when it comes time to mate. For the male, it’s a chance for him to learn if she is really ripe and ready—something he can likely smell and taste. As lobsters have the equivalent of taste buds on their legs, the constant touching between two courting lobsters is really more of a mutual tasting—they are licking each other with their feet. It’s kinky stuff.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "According to Françoise Gilot, Picasso described Maar’s image as an inner vision. “For me she is the weeping woman. For years I’ve painted her in tortured forms, not through sadism, not through pleasure, either; just obeying a vision that forced itself on me. It was the deep reality, not the superficial one.”11 During one of Maar’s early encounters with Picasso, he watched her play the knife game at a café, repeatedly stabbing the spaces between her splayed fingers. Inevitably she missed, cut herself, and bled. As the story goes, Picasso asked for the gloves she had removed and displayed them in a vitrine in his apartment. In 1936, he drew Maar as a beautiful harpy, her head on a bird’s body. Picasso’s biographers have cast their subject’s misogyny and sadism in various lights, but none of them doubts that his fear, cruelty, and ambivalence found their way onto his canvases. Perhaps this was most succinctly stated by Angela Carter: “Picasso liked cutting up women.”12\nThe tearful woman with her weapon-like fingernails clearly has multiple dream-like associations: war, grief, sadistic pleasure. They are all there in the weeping woman.\nIdeas become part of our perceptions, but we are not always conscious of them.\nThe story of art is continually being revised by art movements, by money and collectors, by “definitive” museum shows, by new concerns, discoveries, and ideologies that alter the telling of the past. Every story yokes together disparate elements in time, and every story, by its very nature, leaps over a lot.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "The boundaries of the self (or a form of the self) expand in ownership, and this may explain, at least in part, why art by men is more expensive than art by women. It is not only the fact that most collectors are men. There are many important women in the art world who run galleries, for example, and they also show mostly male artists. In New York City during the last ten years, around 80 percent of all solo shows have been by men. When self-enhancement through art objects is at stake, a largely unconscious bias, not unlike the one hidden in the wine sippers, is at work when it comes to art made by a woman. The highest price paid for a work by a post–Second World War artist was for a Rothko canvas—$86.9 million, which is far more than the highest price paid for a woman (a Louise Bourgeois spider was sold for $10.7 million).",

Indeed, both Rothko and Bourgeois were highly sensitive, troubled, emotional, egotistical people whose characters mingled both classically feminine and masculine qualities. Of the two, Bourgeois was clearly the stronger and, according to the adjectival lists mentioned above, the more “masculine” personality. Rothko killed himself; Bourgeois fought on, working furiously (in all senses of the word) until she died at age ninety-eight. But even in terms of their work, it is hard to characterize either one as masculine or feminine. ",

Wilson, to write a seminal article in the Atlantic Monthly on so-called broken-windows policing. The idea was that low-level crimes and misdemeanors created an atmosphere of disorder in a neighborhood. This scared law-abiding citizens away. The dark and empty streets they left behind were breeding grounds for serious crime. The antidote was for society to resist the spread of disorder.

Troubles never just melt away, and ignoring them only lets them grow bigger, in the dark, unattended. The story is going to force Dorothy to test her assumption: Is running away the best option? Because in the things-go-from-bad-to-worse category, now she’s stuck in Oz, so she can’t just decide she made a mistake and slink back home. Instead, she is going to find out what her misbelief has cost her.\n\t\t\tWhile Dorothy’s external goal is to go home, her real problem is that she doesn’t believe she has the power to solve her problem, so instead of standing up for what she believes in, she runs. Not because she’s weak or lacks courage, but because that’s what, up to that moment, life has taught her the right course of action is. But on the road to the Wicked Witch’s castle in the hopes of solving her external problem, by helping her new friends muster the courage to stand up to bullies and fight for what’s fair, Dorothy discovers her own inner strength, and the antidote to that misbelief.",

The cards are so thin that your vision is not up to the task of distinguishing them, especially in the hands of a skilled card sharp. Your center of gaze is called the macula—the region near the center of your retinas packed with photoreceptors. It, along with the fovea (the very center of the macula and the part with the very highest resolution), is responsible for high-acuity vision. It’s a piece of your anatomy that is so specialized it has its own set of diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. In fact, macular degeneration is the most common form of blindness in older people, as maculas slowly die over the course of a few years. Without maculas, you can see only with your peripheral vision, which has very low resolution. You navigate by seeing the world in terms of what appears off to the sides of your head.",

He’d go off for a day or two, think it through, and come back with the correct answer,” says Hillis. “Then I would repeat the trick using an entirely different method. And it drove him crazy. He never got the meta principle that I changed methods. This may be because of how scientists are trained to use the scientific method. You keep doing experiments until you find the answer. Nature is reliable. The idea that someone would switch methods just flummoxed him.”",

He examined imitation in its own right, and divided it into three sorts. The first he called “mutual transformation,” by which there is a kind of “leveling” among a social group; the second accounts for how we follow fashions and customs, so that we can harmonize with society; and the third is the murkier idea of copying for its own sake.",

As Immanuel Kant argued, the mind has a hard time turning abstract, intellectual ideas into images that we can put into someone else’s mind; and Kant wanted us to be clear that this was down to “the limitations of the human faculties” rather than “the limits of things as they really exist.” One of the things that make it so hard for our faculties is that they can’t keep up with actual things: No sooner have we started to contemplate one thing than another pops up, and the mind is wearied by the hurly-burly of Romantic age life.",

These ideas were expounded by the Swiss linguistic theorist Ferdinand de Saussure (only without the cucumber) around the time of his death in 1913. Later, Claude Lévi-Strauss would use the same thinking to examine social units such as families and tribes: To put it at its most basic, somebody is a son because he has a father. Somebody is an aunt because she has a nephew. Our relationships with each other define who we are, and we fit into our communities as words do into a language.",

This is reflected in dualisms like mind/body, with the mind being nonmaterial, male, and active, and the\n\nbody physical, female, and passive. It is also reflected in the dualism of culture/nature, with the assumption that men alone have access to culture while women are bound up with the earth that bears all things.2 What these artificial dichotomies obscure is that activity, not passivity, is nature’s forte.\nThe new biotechnologies reproduce the old patriarchal divisions of activity/passivity, culture/nature. These dichotomies are then used as instruments of capitalist patriarchy to colonize the regeneration of plants and human beings. Only by decolonizing regeneration can the activity and creativity of women and nature in a nonpatriarchal mold be reclaimed.",

Differences persist—not in the integrating context of plurality, but in the fragmenting context of homogenization. Positive pluralities give way to negative dualities, in competition with each other, contesting for the scarce resources that define economic and political power. Diversity is mutated into duality, into the experience of exclusion. The intolerance of diversity becomes a new social disease, leaving communities vulnerable to breakdown and violence, decay and destruction. The intolerance of diversity and the persistence of cultural differences sets one community against another in a context created by a homogenizing state, carrying out a homogenizing project of development. Difference, instead of leading to the richness of diversity, becomes the basis for division and an ideology of separation.\n\n",

People sense that bent branches tend to spring back, that kudu may tire easily, that porcupines usually leave tracks with two padprints. A propensity cannot be perceived directly (either the branch sprang back or it didn’t), but it can be inferred by scrutinizing the physical makeup of an object and working through the laws of cause and effect.

We also store memories and understanding in the minds of the people we love. You don’t need to remember your child’s emotional relationship to her teacher because you know your wife will; you don’t have to remember how to work the remote because you know your daughter will. That’s transactive memory. Little bits of ourselves reside in other people’s minds. Wegner has a heartbreaking riff about what one member of a couple will often say when the other one dies—that some part of him or her died along with the partner. That, Wegner says, is literally true. When your partner dies, everything that you have stored in that person’s brain is gone.",

When the political scientist Ivan Arreguín-Toft did the calculation a few years ago, what he came up with was 71.5 percent. Just under a third of the time, the weaker country wins.",

So with the butcher surprising it, the turkey will have a revision of belief—right when its confidence in the statement that the butcher loves turkeys is maximal and “it is very quiet” and soothingly predictable in the life of the turkey. This example builds on an adaptation of a metaphor by Bertrand Russell. The key here is that such a surprise will be a Black Swan event; but just for the turkey, not for the butcher.",

Its precise allusion is unclear. The variant, which relies on the meaning of ghost as an insubstantial shadow, dates from the mid-1800s. Also see the synonyms CHANCE; SNOWBALL’S CHANCE IN HELL.",

There they recount what happened when a golf ball hit a crow on a Seattle golf course. The precision strike was an accident, of course; concerned golfers who witnessed the crow go down were startled to see that another crow immediately came to its aid. This second bird pulled on the first crow’s wings, calling out all the while. Five more crows soon arrived. At that point, three crows together “began pecking and pulling on the apparently dead bird, trying to lift it up by the wings.” The golfers assumed the bird would not survive and moved on, only to learn two holes later from other players that the stricken crow had in fact revived and flown off.",

The poll also asked them what they thought the government was spending. Most thought the government was spending far more than it actually was.

He writes of a test in which participants were confronted by a grid of squares on a computer screen. They were asked to click five of them. Some participants found that, with each click, another picture of an animal appeared. But a second group saw small component parts of a single animal. With each square they clicked, another part of a greater picture was revealed. This second group were much more likely to keep on clicking squares after the required five, and then keep going until enough of them had been turned that the mystery of the animal’s identity had been solved. Brains, concluded the researchers, seem to become spontaneously curious when presented with an ‘information set’ they realise is incomplete. ‘There is a natural inclination to resolve information gaps,’ wrote Loewenstein, ‘even for questions of no importance.’",

Those high in extraversion are gregarious and assertive, seekers of attention and sensation.

Lots of openness makes for a curious soul, someone artistic, emotional and comfortable with novelty.

Emodiverse people are less likely to lash out in anger (or hit the bottle in misery) and much less likely to visit the doctor. Those with a high EQ are apparently happier, healthier, and more popular than the rest of us. You are what you feel, as long as you can describe it.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "The concept of Angst was central to the work of the existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. He argued that an individual only becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of Angst, because ‘Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.’\nIf you stand and look over a cliff’s edge, you fear falling but also recognize the opportunity to jump. Kierkegaard believed we experience the same dual response when confronting every significant choice, describing it as ‘the dizziness of freedom’. Angst, he believed, needs to be embraced, because restricting ourselves to the safe and the ordinary means living a lie. Arguably this was something that Kierkegaard pursued in his own life, when, at great personal cost, he deliberately decided not to marry his childhood sweetheart, Regine Olsen, and to dedicate his life instead to philosophy.",

It is made up of the Greek apo, ‘away from’, and anthrōpos, ‘man’. In a medical glossary of 1839, ‘apanthropy’ is neatly defined as ‘a species of melancholy characterised by a dislike to society’. It is, in other words, the state of being ‘peopled out’. Any modern ‘humgruffin’ or misanthrope will relate to that.",

They have, for example, a term for the reproduction of an object within an object, often in endless reflections that recede into infinity. This is mise en abîme, meaning ‘placed into the abyss’ – you will find it on the cover for Pink Floyd’s album Ummagumma, which utilizes the infinity effect through a large mirror.\nAn even more evocative term is l’appel du vide, ‘the call of the void’, which describes the impulse to jump off a cliff as you stare down from its summit, or to drive into the path of oncoming traffic. It can be as strong as it is irrational, and thankfully few of us give in to it. But the mind is seduced by the abyss as if by some strange compulsion, perhaps as a reverse affirmation of the desire to live.

Clever, colourful, and frequently irreverent, much of it is echoed in the bingo hall (and the bedroom – where else but darts would a rubber, the final game of a match, be called the prophylactic?). Much of the lingo comes from London’s East End and its home-grown rhyming slang. Thus a Big Ben is a 10, beehives a double 5, chopsticks a 6, dinky doo a 22, old hens a double 10, and two whores a double 4. Bedrooms crop up again in bed and breakfast: 26 from three darts, based on the standard price of B&B in England in the early twentieth century: namely two shillings and sixpence. The bull, meanwhile, is variously known as the bugbutton, bunghole (referring to the bunghole of a beer barrel, said to have been used in early darts matches), cherry, dosser, middle, and tit.\n",

It is, in other words, all about the journey, which makes it a cousin of such words as ‘roaming’ and ‘roving’, or the Irish seachrán, to ‘wander’ or ‘stray’. Whilst all of these suggest something aimless and dawdling, however, ‘coddiwompling’ has far more determination. You may not know where you’re going, but wherever it is, you’ll get there.",

In the statement “I promise you that I did not steal the money,” the phrase “I promise you” is a performative. It is simply claiming “I say to you” or “I am uttering the following words to you.” What is interesting about performative statements is that they cannot be assessed on their truthfulness. In the sentence starting with “I promise you,” the claim “I did not steal the money” is not directly asserted. The truth of the phrase is that the speaker is merely saying that he or she promises that they didn’t steal the money. It’s a fine distinction but one used surprisingly frequently.",

Our brains are highly attentive to change. In this situation, the innocent person is detecting that something is “off” or not making sense. Consequently, he or she starts paying closer attention, resulting in higher style matching.

In the case of deceptiveness, one of the speakers—the person who is lying—is actually paying less attention to the other person. Intuitively, you would think that this would result in lower levels of style matching. Apparently when we talk with liars we start paying more attention in an attempt to decode their odd language change. In the case of deception, as one person becomes less attentive, the other becomes more attentive. Surprisingly, this occurs far more frequently than you might think.",

This thought leader’s mission, Sessions argues convincingly, is “to mirror, systematize, and popularize the delusions of the superrich: that they have earned their fortunes on merit, that social protections need to be further eviscerated to make everyone more flexible for ‘the future,’ and that local attachments and alternative ways of living should be replaced by an aspirational consumerism.”1 And while thought leadership has the hackneyed air of an overused recent coinage, it is, like innovation, an old concept that thinks it is utterly new.",

As a result, excellence is often accused of being an empty platitude when it is not derided as a form of undercover elitism.

But in scaling up from a particular module to a semester-long class or a course of study, learning outcomes cannot help but be general, even rote recitations of general ambitions, rather than measurable tasks.

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "These elements of a passion are elusive and not easily commodifiable—if they were, Phoenix newspapers would not run regular articles bemoaning Arizona fans’ lack of passion. This dilemma has not stopped marketers and management scholars from developing metrics for measuring passion, though. One scholar, a true romantic named Michael Lewis, calls passion “fan equity.” Passion, therefore, is a pillar of late capitalist ideology, but passion is also a social feeling that lives on the edge of what can be captured by the market: passion is, as it has always been, mysterious, dangerous, and somewhat unmanageable. In other words, you can never really bottle and sell it, try though you might. And many do try: passion is the “secret sauce” for success, according to more than a few business writers, their metaphors for life’s deepest mysteries apparently limited to McDonald’s condiments.6",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "GEORGE DAWES GREEN, MOTH FOUNDER: Every good story, I feel certain, hinges on a decision. Sometimes there’ll be lots of decisions in the course of a narrative: backtracks, double-downs, veerings off, choices made by other characters, your replies to those choices. But always, at the story’s core, will be one key decision. In the most powerful stories, your decision will be a tough one. (Some of your audience will concur with your choice, some will be appalled!) Good storytellers soon learn that what happened is of less importance: Your audience really wants to know what you decided to do about what happened. I’ve often been told stories of harrowing auto accidents. I usually find these tales kind of dull. But once, a man told me of a long icy skid that took him over a bridge and into a small river. The car was completely submerged, but the windows were shut and he had plenty of air—and so he had to make a choice. Should he lower the window, let the river come rushing into the car so he could try to escape, or just wait in that air-bubble for help? The story instantly took power. The decision.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

A little more work established that indeed, the crickets in Hilo—and, as it turned out, on Kauai and Oahu as well—didn’t only attract the attention of amorous females when they called. They also risked being discovered by flies that use the chirps in a much more sinister way. Once a female fly locates a calling cricket, she deposits tiny larvae on him. A larva, usually one but sometimes two or even three, burrows inside the cricket’s body and starts, ever so slowly, to eat his flesh while he is still alive. First it feeds on his body fat, but eventually, as the fly maggot grows until it occupies the entire body, from head to abdomen, it consumes the male’s other organs, so that he is a shell that looks like a cricket but is pulsing inside with fly.",

Then, the locusts were deprived of food for four hours, a rather long time between meals for the insects, which usually eat more or less nonstop. When the locusts were placed in a test chamber containing yellow and green tubes, but no food, they went to the color associated with the nutrient—either protein or carbs—they had been lacking. This feat is particularly impressive because it isn’t just the grasshoppers having some holistic instinct for eating what is good for them, but a learned association between color and a nutritional deficit.

Now, I can usually sell people on crickets, and ladybugs, ants, and bees already get their own movies, toys, and children’s songs. People are less than enthusiastic, though, about the possibility of a sparkling intellect lurking in the sesame seed-sized flies that buzz in clouds around decaying fruit. But in Tad Kawecki’s laboratory at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, fruit flies are contestants in an unending game of Jeopardy, insect style. And some of them are big winners.",

Through the selective breeding process, the flies rapidly improved their ability to remember which substance was attractive and which was not, and after about twenty generations, Kawecki had flies that could go to the bug equivalent of Harvard or Princeton. Instead of taking three hours to learn which substance has quinine in it, the new and improved flies knocked the task out in less than an hour. What’s more, they could generalize their ability to other tasks that required them to avoid or prefer one odor to another, and even to other stimuli besides odor, which means that the flies were not simply evolving better discrimination of pineapple versus orange, they were actually getting smarter.",

    "ZANNOTATIONSELECTEDTEXT": "Fuck ‘Fuck’ contains four letters in search of an etymology. It is, sadly, easy to dismiss the popular myth that ‘fuck’ is an acronym, said to have arisen during a time of plague when the population was in perilous decline, prompting the monarch to instruct all fertile couples to go forth and procreate. These couples would hang a sign outside their house to warn against disturbance, because they were engaged in Fornicating Under Command of the King. There is no evidence at all to support this, and a possible, darker, source is the Latin pugnare, ‘to fight’. Many of the earliest references to ‘fuck’ involve hitting people rather than having sex. If this is indeed the root of the word, then the meaning was perhaps extended to reflect a misogynistic view of man’s power over women.",

For example, one might consider a plant’s phototropic capacity to seek sunlight to be a kind of agency, without meaning to ascribe consciousness to the plant.

It is not impossible to fake, but it is risky to do so – being highly visible but not poisonous is a mimicry strategy adopted by certain non-venomous snakes, for instance. What makes it risky is that, if any predator learns to tell you apart from the dangerous species you are imitating, he stands to make a killing – at your expense.",

The sole use of watches, however, is to tell us what o’clock it is, and to hinder us from breaking any engagement, or suffering any other inconveniency by our ignorance in that particular point. But the person so nice with regard to this machine, will not always be found either more scrupulously punctual than other men, or more anxiously concerned . . . to know precisely what time of day it is.

When Ogilvy was asked to increase the level of waste recycling in British homes we made the suggestion of shelving all discussion of what a household thinks about the growth of landfill or the loss of polar bears; instead we suggested that the principal behavioural driver of recycling is to do with circumstances rather than attitude. Put bluntly, if you have two bins in your kitchen, you’ll separate your recyclable rubbish and recycle quite a lot, but if you have only one bin you probably won’t. Under the slogan ‘One bin is rubbish’ we focused our campaign entirely around encouraging people to have more than one bin in their household – avoiding the issue of how to convert people to be card-carrying members of the green movement.*",
