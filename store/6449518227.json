And the BBC presenter and journalist Ros Atkins, creator of the viral 'Ros Atkins on...' explainer videos, is something of a master of the form. In this book, Ros shares the secrets he has learned from years of working in high-pressure newsrooms, identifying the ten elements of a good explanation and the seven steps you need to take to express yourself with clarity and impact.<br /><br />Whether at work, school, university or home, we all benefit from being able to articulate ourselves clearly. Filled with practical examples, <i>The Art of Explanation </i>is a must-read for anyone who wants to sharpen their communication skills."
