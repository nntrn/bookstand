    "standard": "<b>In his \"remarkable\" (<i>Men's Journal</i>) and \"controversial\" (<i>Fortune</i>) book -- written in a \"wry, amusing style\" (<i>The Guardian</i>) -- Bruce Cannon Gibney shows how America was hijacked by the Boomers, a generation whose reckless self-indulgence degraded the foundations of American prosperity.</b><br /><br /> In <i>A Generation of Sociopaths</i>, Gibney examines the disastrous policies of the most powerful generation in modern history, showing how the Boomers ruthlessly enriched themselves at the expense of future generations.<br /><br />Acting without empathy, prudence, or respect for facts--acting, in other words, as sociopaths--the Boomers turned American dynamism into stagnation, inequality, and bipartisan fiasco. The Boomers have set a time bomb for the 2030s, when damage to Social Security, public finances, and the environment will become catastrophic and possibly irreversible--and when, not coincidentally, Boomers will be dying off. <br /><br />Gibney argues that younger generations have a fleeting window to hold the Boomers accountable and begin restoring America."
