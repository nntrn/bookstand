    "standard": "<b>For anyone who has ever wanted to take an acting class, <b>\"this is the best book on acting written in the last twenty years\" (David Mamet, from the Introduction).<br /></b></b><br />This book describes a technique developed and refined by the authors, all of them young actors, in their work with Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet, actor W. H. Macy, and director Gregory Mosher. A Practical Handbook for the Actor is written for any actor who has ever experienced the frustrations of acting classes that lacked clarity and objectivity, and that failed to provide a dependable set of tools. An actor's job, the authors state, is to \"find a way to live truthfully under the imaginary circumstances of the play.\" The ways in which an actor can attain that truth form the substance of this eloquent book."
