    "standard": "<b>What happens when media and politics become forms of entertainment? As our world begins to look more and more like Orwell's <i>1984</i>, Neil's Postman's essential guide to the modern media is more relevant than ever.<br /><br /></b>\"It's unlikely that Trump has ever read&#xa0;<i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i>, but his ascent would not have surprised Postman.” -<i>CNN</i><br /><br />Originally published in 1985, Neil Postman’s groundbreaking polemic about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse has been hailed as a twenty-first-century book published in the twentieth century. Now, with television joined by more sophisticated electronic media—from the Internet to cell phones to DVDs—it has taken on even greater significance. <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> is a prophetic look at what happens when politics, journalism, education, and even religion become subject to the demands of&#xa0; entertainment. It is also a blueprint for regaining control of our media, so that they can serve our highest goals.<br /><br />“A brilliant, powerful, and important book. This is an indictment that Postman has laid down and, so far as I can see, an irrefutable one.” –Jonathan Yardley,&#xa0;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i>"
