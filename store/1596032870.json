    "standard": "<b>The acclaimed food critic’s two-thousand-year history of going out to eat, from the ancient Romans in Pompeii to the luxurious Michelin-starred restaurants of today.</b><br /><br />Starting with the surprisingly sophisticated dining scene in the city of Pompeii, William Sitwell embarks on a romp through culinary history, meeting the characters and discovering the events that shape the way we eat today. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> restaurant critic and famously acerbic <i>MasterChef</i> commentator, Sitwell discusses everything from the far-reaching influences of the Muslim world to the unintended consequences of the French Revolution. He reveals the full hideous glory of Britain’s post-WWII dining scene and fathoms the birth of sensitive gastronomy in the counterculture of 1960’s America.<br /> This is a story of human ingenuity as individuals endeavor to do that most fundamental of things: to feed people. It is a story of art, politics, revolution, desperate need, and decadent pleasure. <i>The Restaurant</i> is jam-packed with extraordinary facts and colorful episodes; an accessible and humorous history of a truly universal subject."
