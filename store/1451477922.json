By spinning 28 engaging mathematical tales, Orlin shows us that calculus is simply another language to express the very things we humans grapple with every day -- love, risk, time, and most importantly, change. Divided into two parts, \"Moments\" and \"Eternities,\" and drawing on everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Mark Twain to David Foster Wallace, <i>Change is the Only Constant</i> unearths connections between calculus, art, literature, and a beloved dog named Elvis. This is not just math for math's sake; it's math for the sake of becoming a wiser and more thoughtful human."
