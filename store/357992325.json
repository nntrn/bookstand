    "standard": "<b>This <i>New York Times </i>bestseller is the hilarious philosophy course everyone wishes they’d had in school.</b><br />Outrageously funny, <i>Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar</i>... has been a breakout bestseller ever since authors—and born vaudevillians—Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein did their schtick on NPR’s <i>Weekend Edition</i>. Lively, original, and powerfully informative, <i>Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar</i>... is a not-so-reverent crash course through the great philosophical thinkers and traditions, from Existentialism (<i>What do Hegel and Bette Midler have in common?</i>) to Logic (<i>Sherlock Holmes never deduced anything</i>). Philosophy 101 for those who like to take the heavy stuff lightly, this is a joy to read—and finally, it all makes sense!<br /><br />And now, you can read Daniel Klein's further musings on life and philosophy in <i>Travels with Epicurus</i>&#xa0;and <i>Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change it</i>.&#xa0;"
