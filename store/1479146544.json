    "standard": "<b>The bestselling popular science author “</b><b>has made it his mission to tackle myths about science and the so-called experts who spread them” (</b><b>CBC Radio).</b><br /> &#xa0;<br /> The internet is a powerful beast when it comes to science; the answer to any query you may have is just a few keystrokes away. But when there are multiple answers from various sources, how do we know what information is reliable? In <i>Monkeys, Myths, and Molecules, </i>bestselling author Dr. Joe Schwarcz takes a critical look at how facts are misconstrued in the media. He debunks the myths surrounding canned food, artificial dyes, SPF, homeopathy, cancer, chemicals, and much more.<br /> &#xa0;<br /> Unafraid to expose the sheer nonsense people are led to believe about health, food, drugs, and our environment, Dr. Joe confronts pseudoscience and convincingly and entertainingly advocates for a scientific approach to everyday life.<br /> &#xa0;<br /> “A compendium of short articles on a variety of subjects, written in a humorous, accessible style, and larded with intriguing trivia&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;. Dr. Joe skewers food myths, opposition to GMOs, Dr. Oz, and Vani Hari, aka the Food Babe.” —Science-Based Medicine<br /> &#xa0;<br /> “Ultimately, the author successfully demonstrates how claims should be queried and analyzed before they are accepted&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;. Recommended for readers of health, nutrition, and popular science.” —<i>Library Journal</i><br /> &#xa0;<br /> “The book is chock-full of captivating anecdotes&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;. The author engages readers with his wit and wisdom.” —<i>The Canadian Jewish News</i>"
