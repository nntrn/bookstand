    "standard": "<b>This <i>New York Times</i> bestseller is an exciting and fearless investigation of language from the author of <i>Rationality</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Better Angels of Our Nature </i>and <i>The Sense of Style </i>and <i>Enlightenment Now.<br /><br /></i>\"Curious, inventive, fearless, naughty.\"<i><br />--The <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br /></i></b> Bestselling author Steven Pinker possesses that rare combination of scientific aptitude and verbal eloquence that enables him to provide lucid explanations of deep and powerful ideas. His previous books - including the Pulitzer Prize finalist <i>The Blank Slate -</i> have catapulted him into the limelight as one of today's most important popular science writers. In <i>The Stuff of Thought</i>, Pinker presents a fascinating look at how our words explain our nature. Considering scientific questions with examples from everyday life, <i>The Stuff of Thought</i> is a brilliantly crafted and highly readable work that will appeal to fans of everything from <i>The Selfish Gene</i> and <i>Blink</i> to <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>."
