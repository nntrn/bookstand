    "standard": "<b>A pioneering proposal for a pluralistic extension of evolutionary theory, now updated to reflect the most recent research<br /><br /></b>This updated edition of the widely read <i>Evolution in Four Dimensions</i> has been revised to reflect the spate of new discoveries in biology since the book was first published in 2005, offering corrections, an updated bibliography, and a substantial new chapter. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb's pioneering argument proposes that there is more to heredity than genes. <br /><br />They describe 4 “dimensions” in heredity—4 inheritance systems that play a role in evolution which,&#xa0;&#xa0;they argue, can all provide variations on which natural selection can act:<br /><br />• genetic<br />•&#xa0;epigenetic (or non-DNA cellular transmission of traits)<br />•&#xa0;behavioral<br />•&#xa0;symbolic (transmission through language and other forms of symbolic communication)<br /><br />Jablonka and Lamb present a richer, more complex view of evolution than that offered by the gene-based Modern Synthesis, arguing that induced and acquired changes also play a role. Their lucid and accessible text is accompanied by artist-physician Anna Zeligowski's lively drawings, which humorously and effectively illustrate the authors' points. <br /><br />Each chapter ends with a dialogue in which the authors refine their arguments against the vigorous skepticism of the fictional “I.M.” (for Ipcha Mistabra—Aramaic for “the opposite conjecture”). The extensive new chapter, presented engagingly as a dialogue with I.M., updates the information on each of the 4 dimensions—with special attention to the epigenetic, where there has been an explosion of new research."
