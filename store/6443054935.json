    "standard": "<b>“This short book makes you smarter than 99% of the population. . . . The concepts within it will increase your company's ‘organizational intelligence.’. . . It’s more than just a must-read, it’s a&#xa0;‘have-to-read-or-you’re-fired’ book”—Geoffrey James, INC.com&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;</b><br /><br /><b>From the author of <i>An Illustrated Book of Loaded Language, </i>here’s the antidote to fuzzy thinking, with furry animals!</b><br /><br />Have you read (or stumbled into) one too many irrational online debates? Ali Almossawi certainly had, so he wrote <i>An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments</i>! This handy guide is here to bring the internet age a much-needed dose of old-school logic (really old-school, <i>a la</i> Aristotle).<br /><br />Here are cogent explanations of the <b><i>straw man</i></b> fallacy, the <i><b>slippery slope</b></i> argument, the <i><b>ad hominem</b></i> attack, and other common attempts at reasoning that actually fall short—plus a beautifully drawn menagerie of animals who (adorably) commit every logical <i>faux pas</i>. Rabbit thinks a strange light in the sky <i>must</i> be a UFO because no one can prove otherwise (<i><b>the appeal to ignorance</b></i>). And Lion doesn’t believe that gas emissions harm the planet because, if that <i>were</i> true, he wouldn’t like the result (the <i><b>argument from consequences</b></i>).<br /><br />Once you learn to recognize these abuses of reason, they start to crop up everywhere from congressional debate to YouTube comments—which makes this geek-chic book a <i>must</i> for anyone in the habit of holding opinions."
