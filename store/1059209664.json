    "standard": "<b>Following on the heels of Lisa Cron's breakout first book, <i>Wired for Story</i>, this writing guide reveals how to use cognitive storytelling strategies to build a scene-by-scene blueprint for a riveting story</b>. <br /><br />It’s every novelist’s greatest fear: pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into writing hundreds of pages only to realize that their story has no sense of urgency, no internal logic, and so is a page one rewrite.&#xa0;<br /><br />The prevailing wisdom in the writing community is that there are just two ways around this problem: pantsing (winging it) and plotting (focusing on the external plot). Story coach Lisa Cron has spent her career discovering why these methods don’t work and coming up with a powerful alternative, based on the science behind what our brains are wired to crave in every story we read (and it’s not what you think).&#xa0;<br /><br />In <i>Story Genius </i>Cron takes you, step-by-step, through the creation of a novel from the first glimmer of an idea, to a complete multilayered blueprint—including fully realized scenes—that evolves into a first draft with the authority, richness, and command of a riveting sixth or seventh draft."
