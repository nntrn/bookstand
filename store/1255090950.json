    "standard": "<b>“The best education in grand strategy available in a single volume . . . a book that should be read by every American leader or would-be leader.”—<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br /><br />A master class in strategic thinking, distilled from the legendary program the author has co-taught at Yale for decades</b><br /><br />John Lewis Gaddis, the distinguished historian of the Cold War, has for almost two decades co-taught grand strategy at Yale University with his colleagues Charles Hill and Paul Kennedy.&#xa0; Now, in <i>On Grand Strategy</i>, Gaddis reflects on what he has learned.&#xa0; In chapters extending from the ancient world through World War II, Gaddis assesses grand strategic theory and practice in Herodotus, Thucydides, Sun Tzu, Octavian/Augustus, St. Augustine, Machiavelli, Elizabeth I, Philip II, the American Founding Fathers, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Lincoln, Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Isaiah Berlin.&#xa0; <i>On Grand Strategy</i> applies the sharp insights and wit readers have come to expect from Gaddis to times, places, and people he’s never written about before.&#xa0; For anyone interested in the art of leadership, <i>On Grand Strategy</i> is, in every way, a master class."
