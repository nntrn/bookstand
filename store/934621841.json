    "standard": "<b>Does the universe embody beautiful ideas?</b><br /><br />Artists as well as scientists throughout human&#xa0;history have pondered this “beautiful question.”&#xa0;With Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek as your guide,&#xa0;embark on a voyage of related discoveries, from&#xa0;Plato and Pythagoras up to the present. Wilczek’s&#xa0;groundbreaking work in quantum physics was&#xa0;inspired by his intuition to look for a deeper order&#xa0;of beauty in nature. In fact, every major advance&#xa0;in his career came from this intuition: to assume&#xa0;that the universe embodies beautiful forms, forms&#xa0;whose hallmarks are symmetry—harmony,&#xa0;balance, proportion—and economy. There are&#xa0;other meanings of “beauty,” but this is the deep&#xa0;logic of the universe—and it is no accident that&#xa0;it is also at the heart of what we find aesthetically&#xa0;pleasing and inspiring.<br /><br />Wilczek is hardly alone among great scientists&#xa0;in charting his course using beauty as his compass.&#xa0;As he reveals in <i>A Beautiful Question</i>, this has been&#xa0;the heart of scientific pursuit from Pythagoras, the&#xa0;ancient Greek who was the first to argue that “all&#xa0;things are number,” to Galileo, Newton, Maxwell,&#xa0;Einstein, and into the deep waters of twentiethcentury&#xa0;physics. Though the ancients weren’t&#xa0;right about everything, their ardent belief in the&#xa0;music of the spheres has proved true down to the&#xa0;quantum level. Indeed, Wilczek explores just how&#xa0;intertwined our ideas about beauty and art are with&#xa0;our scientific understanding of the cosmos.<br /><br />Wilczek brings us right to the edge of knowledge&#xa0;today, where the core insights of even the craziest&#xa0;quantum ideas apply principles we all understand.&#xa0;The equations for atoms and light are almost&#xa0;literally the same equations that govern musical&#xa0;instruments and sound; the subatomic particles&#xa0;that are responsible for most of our mass are&#xa0;determined by simple geometric symmetries. The&#xa0;universe itself, suggests Wilczek, seems to want to&#xa0;embody beautiful and elegant forms. Perhaps this&#xa0;force is the pure elegance of numbers, perhaps the&#xa0;work of a higher being, or somewhere between.&#xa0;Either way, we don’t depart from the infinite and&#xa0;infinitesimal after all; we’re profoundly connected&#xa0;to them, and we connect them. When we find that&#xa0;our sense of beauty is realized in the physical world,&#xa0;we are discovering something about the world, but&#xa0;also something about ourselves.<br /><br />Gorgeously illustrated, <i>A Beautiful Question</i> is a&#xa0;mind-shifting book that braids the age-old quest&#xa0;for beauty and the age-old quest for truth into a&#xa0;thrilling synthesis. It is a dazzling and important&#xa0;work from one of our best thinkers, whose humor&#xa0;and infectious sense of wonder animate every page.&#xa0;Yes: The world is a work of art, and its deepest&#xa0;truths are ones we already feel, as if they were&#xa0;somehow written in our souls."
