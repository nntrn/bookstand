    "standard": "Did you know that . . . a soldier's biggest social blunder is called <b>jack brew</b> - making yourself a cuppa without making one for anyone else? That twitchers have an expression for a bird that can't be identified - <b>LBJ</b> (the letters stand for <b>L</b>ittle <b>B</b>rown <b>J</b>ob)? Or that builders call plastering the ceiling <b>doing Lionel Richie's dancefloor</b>? Susie Dent does.<br /><br />Ever wondered why football managers all speak the same way, what a cabbie calls the Houses of Parliament, or how ticket inspectors discreetly request back-up? We are surrounded by hundreds of tribes, each speaking their own distinct slanguage of colourful words, jokes and phrases, honed through years of conversations on the battlefield, in A&amp;E, backstage, or at ten-thousand feet in the air. <br /><br />Susie Dent has spent years interviewing hundreds of professionals, hobbyists and enthusiasts, and the result is an idiosyncratic phrasebook like no other. From the Freemason's handshake to the publican's banter, <i>Dent's Modern Tribes</i> takes us on a whirlwind tour of Britain, decoding its secret languages and, in the process, finds out what really makes us all tick."
