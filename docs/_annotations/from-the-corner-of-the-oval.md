*  The funny thing is, nobody cares what you do. They don't ask because they're curious about how you spend your day or what you're interested in. What D.C. creatures really care about is whether you're important or connected or powerful or wealthy

*  D.C. is the girl who never swears and always wears a full face of makeup; the guy who makes a weekend "brunch rezzie" for him and his ten closest bros and thinks tipping 15 percent is totally solid. I moved to the city with two suitcases and my eyes wide open—I'd use D.C. to build my résumé, and D.C. would take all my money for rent and bland $11 sandwiches.
