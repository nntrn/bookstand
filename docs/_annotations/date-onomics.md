## 1 The Man Deficit

*  According to 22 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, there are 5. million college-educated women in the U.S. between the ages of 2 and 2 versus 4. million such men. In other words, the dating pool for college graduates in their twenties really does have 3 percent more women than men—or four women for every three men.

*  In Manhattan, the pool of 2-and-under college grads has 3 percent more women than men

*  There are lots of women, including ambitious women who move to New York City to work, expecting to meet ambitious men," Notkin wrote. "Only, the men don't follow."

*  My argument is more macro than micro—that gender ratios are the key variable in explaining long-term trends such as the decline in marriage rates and loosening sexual mores for heterosexual, college-educated men and women

*  Our brains are hardwired to overreact, which is why Zweig cautions investors against bailing on promising stocks after one poor quarter or one scary headline

*  For a while, the January Effect was a boon to stock market insiders who understood what was going on and thus were able to pick up stocks on the cheap in December and then flip them for quick profits come January

*  Because men put more effort into dating when women are scarce—and also because "mating effort is associated with impulsivity"—Ackerman and his colleagues predicted that people living in cities with higher ratios of men to women would own more credit cards and carry more debt

*  Turned out that men were indeed more financially impulsive when they had to compete: "A relative abundance of single men in America was related to both owning more credit cards and having a higher amount of debt."
