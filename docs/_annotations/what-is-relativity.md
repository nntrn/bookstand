*  But I'll let you in on a little secret that's actually important to understanding relativity: Black holes don't suck. If the Sun suddenly became a black hole, Earth would become very cold and dark. However, since we've assumed that the black hole will have the same mass as the Sun, Earth's orbit would hardly be affected at all.
