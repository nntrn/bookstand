*  Pythagoras had now proved not only that the structure of the universe can be
   
   explained in mathematical terms—"number is the ruler of forms"—but also that
   
   acoustics is an exact science, and number governs harmonious proportions. He
   
   then started to apply his theories to the whole cosmos, demonstrating the
   
   harmonic relationship of the stars, planets, and elements. His idea of harmonic
   
   relationships between the stars was eagerly taken up by medieval and Renaissance
   
   astronomers, who developed whole theories around the idea of the music of the
   
   spheres, and his suggestion that the elements were arranged harmoniously was
   
   revisited over 2,000 years after his death. In 1865 English chemist John
   
   Newlands discovered that when the chemical elements are arranged according to
   
   atomic weight, those with similar properties occur at every eighth element, like
   
   notes of music. This discovery became known as the Law of Octaves, and it helped
   
   lead to the development of the Periodic Law of chemical elements still used
   
   today.

*  Like most Eastern
   
   philosophers, he was not interested in the unanswerable questions of metaphysics
   
   that preoccupied the Greeks. Dealing with entities beyond our experience, this kind
   
   of enquiry was senseless speculation. Instead, he concerned himself with the
   
   question of the goal of life, which in turn involved examining the concepts of
   
   happiness, virtue, and the "good" life.

*  Confucius does not prescribe what to do, only
   
   what not to do, emphasizing restraint rather than action. This implies modesty
   
   and humility—values traditionally held in high regard in Chinese society, and
   
   which for Confucius express our true nature

*  Socrates is often referred to as one of the founders of Western
   
   philosophy, and yet he wrote nothing, established no school, and held no particular
   
   theories of his own. What he did do, however, was persistently ask the questions
   
   that interested him, and in doing so evolved a new way of thinking, or a new way of
   
   examining what we think

*  However, he was not interested in winning
   
   arguments, or arguing for the sake of making money—a charge that was leveled at
   
   many of his contemporaries. Nor was he seeking answers or explanations—he was
   
   simply examining the basis of the concepts we apply to ourselves (such as
   
   "good", "bad", and "just"), for he believed that understanding what we are is
   
   the first task of philosophy.

*  But what exactly is involved in this examination of life? For Socrates it was
   
   a process of questioning the meaning of essential concepts that we use every day
   
   but have never really thought about, thereby revealing their real meaning and
   
   our own knowledge or ignorance.

*  It was the conversation itself, with Socrates guiding
   
   it, that provided him with insights. Through a series of questions, he revealed
   
   the ideas and assumptions his opponent held, then exposed the contradictions
   
   within them and brought them to agree to a new set of conclusions.

*  Voltaire refutes the idea of certainty in two ways. First, he points out that
   
   apart from a few necessary truths of mathematics and logic, nearly every fact and
   
   theory in history has been revised at some point in time. So what appears to be
   
   "fact" is actually little more than a working hypothesis. Second, he agrees with
   
   Locke that there is no such thing as an innate idea, and points out that ideas we
   
   seem to know as true from birth may be only cultural, as these change from country
   
   to country.

*  In one of his most famous discussions of the
   
   psychology of bargaining, he contends that the most frequent opening gambit in a
   
   bargain is for one party to urge the other—"the best way for you to
   
   get what you want is for you to give me what
   
   I want." In other words, "we address
   
   ourselves, not to [another's] humanity, but to their self-love."

*  According to Kant, we can only
   
   experience time through things in the world that move or change, such as
   
   the hands of a clock. So time is only ever experienced by us
   
   indirectly.
