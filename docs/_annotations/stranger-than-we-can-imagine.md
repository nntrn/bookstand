*  He wouldn't be deleting "space" itself. He would be removing the frame of reference that we were using to define space. He would do this because it was not a feature of the real world

*  Cubist painters weren't radical in their choice of subject. Like the painters who came before them, they were more than happy to paint naked women and still-life groupings of fruit and wine. It was not their subjects that made them radical, but their attempt to create a new and more truthful way of seeing the familiar. As Picasso once said, "I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them."

*  Without that central tone, which all the other notes are based on, we become adrift in what Professor Erik Levi called "the abyss of no tonal centre."
