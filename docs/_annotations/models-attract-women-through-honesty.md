## Chapter 1: Non-Neediness

*  Highly needy men will end up in relationships
   sometimes, but only with highly needy women. The highly needy man
   is constantly working to earn a woman's approval, and a highly
   needy woman is constantly in need of a man's approval. So the two
   conspire together, usually with one creating drama/emotional
   meltdowns and the other one endlessly fixing it. This relationship
   is toxic and can harm each person's self-worth.

## Chapter 2: Power in Vulnerability

*  For instance, making yourself vulnerable
   doesn't just mean being willing to share your fears or
   insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you
   can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an
   opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of
   people you don't know, telling a woman that you like her and want
   to date her. All of these things require you to stick your neck out
   on the line emotionally in some way. You're making yourself
   vulnerable when you do them.

*  As vulnerability researcher Brene Brown says, "The
   less you talk about your shame, the more of it you have."

## Chapter 3: The Gift of Truth

*  You can say the lamest and grossest (or
   funniest, depending on your perspective) thing to women, and if the
   sub-communication is, "I really don't care if you laugh or run away
   horrified, but here's who I am, take it or leave it," this
   sub-communicates a rock-bottom level of investment and an
   incredibly high level of vulnerability.

*  Again, being a
   "nice guy" is never much different than being a narcissist. One
   only gives. The other only takes. But both are the same in their
   desperation for approval.
