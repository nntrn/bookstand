*  A fatal flaw is the character's blind spot. He doesn't see the damage it does, only the benefit of it stopping a problem before it can start. In the story, the fatal flaw will stand in the character's way of what he wants most. Until he realizes how his dysfunctional behavior and attitudes are limiting him and adopts a healthier approach, he will continue to fail to achieve his heart's desire. Ironically, failure aids in this process by shining a light on the character's flaw and making it harder and harder to ignore.

*  Conflict is the event that demands a response; external or internal, it drives the character to make a decision. And there's no way out of it, because not choosing is also a choice that generates its own consequences.

*  Consequences are the result of the character's choice and can be positive (the right decision leading to a reward) or negative (fallout that hurts the character and makes the goal harder to achieve). In storytelling, consequences usually have strings attached—meaning, even if a character goes with the best option, there will be new problems, challenges, and unforeseen circumstances to navigate.

*  Hobson's Choice: Have you ever been offered something you don't really want, but maybe it's slightly better than nothing? That's a Hobson's choice. An example would be applying for a promotion and instead being given the choice of a deep pay cut or being laid off.

*  Sophie's Choice: This scenario is one where the character must choose between two equally horrible options. Named for the book (and movie) Sophie's Choice, in which the character must decide which of her two children will be killed, this is known as the impossible, tragic choice. However, it can also simply be a time-and-place decision, when the character can only be in one place at that time. And the ramifications don't have to be catastrophic. They can be minor—as in the case of the character being able to attend their own college graduation or their grandmother's 100th birthday party. Regardless of the decision, guilt will accompany the character's choice in this kind of scenario.

*  Morton's Fork: This choice is agonizing because both options lead to the same end. It's Max (Mad Max) handcuffing Johnny the Boy to a gas tanker that has a time-delay fuse and handing him a hacksaw. Dying from the explosion or the loss of blood from cutting off his own ankle … it's a deceptive choice because there is only one outcome.
