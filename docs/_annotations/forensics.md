*  In 1794, Edward Culshaw was murdered with a pistol shot to the head. Back then, pistols were muzzle-loaded and a wad of crushed paper was tamped down to secure the balls and the powder in the gun. When the surgeon examined the body, he found the wad inside the head wound. He opened it up and it was revealed to be the torn corner of a ballad sheet.
   
   The murder suspect, John Toms, was searched. In his pocket was a ballad sheet, the torn corner of which matched exactly the pistol wad. At his trial in Lancaster, Toms was convicted of murder.

*  We crime writers sometimes like to claim our genre has its roots in the deepest recesses of literary history. We claim antecedents in the Bible: fraud in the Garden of Eden; fratricide by Cain of Abel; the manslaughter of Uriah by King David. We try to convince ourselves that Shakespeare was one of us. 
   
   But the truth is that crime fiction proper only began with an evidence-based legal system. And that is what those pioneering scientists and detectives bequeathed us.
