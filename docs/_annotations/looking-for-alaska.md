## introduction

*  I heard a psychologist say that Americans would organize their memories around that terrible day: before and after.

## fifty-one days after

*  And you're gonna fall apart. The cells and organs and systems that make you youâ€”they came together, grew together, and so must fall apart. The Buddha knew one thing science didn't prove for millennia after his death: Entropy increases. Things fall apart."

*  The Buddha said that suffering was caused by desire, we'd learned, and that the cessation of desire meant the cessation of suffering

*  When you stopped wishing things wouldn't fall apart, you'd stop suffering when they did.

## one hundred thirty-six days after

*  If only we could see the endless string of consequences that result from our smallest actions. But we can't know better until knowing better is useless.
