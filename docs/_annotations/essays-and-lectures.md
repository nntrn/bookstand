*  Having done this, you must place your workman in the midst of
   beautiful surroundings. The artist is not dependent on the visible
   and the tangible. He has his visions and his dreams to feed on.
   But the workman must see lovely forms as he goes to his work in the
   morning and returns at eventide. And, in connection with this, I
   want to assure you that noble and beautiful designs are never the
   result of idle fancy or purposeless day-dreaming. They come only
   as the accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation.
   And yet such things may not be taught. Right ideas concerning them
   can certainly be obtained only by those who have been accustomed to
   rooms that are beautiful and colours that are satisfying.

*  The conditions of art should be simple. A great deal more depends
   upon the heart than upon the head. Appreciation of art is not
   secured by any elaborate scheme of learning. Art requires a good
   healthy atmosphere. The motives for art are still around about us
   as they were round about the ancients. And the subjects are also
   easily found by the earnest sculptor and the painter. Nothing is
   more picturesque and graceful than a man at work. The artist who
   goes to the children's playground, watches them at their sport and
   sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the same themes that
   engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such observation
   and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct that
   foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always
   divorced.
