## WHAT LIES AHEAD

*  You want us to tell you that people can change—but the truth of the matter is that it's called a breakup because it's broken. Even if you can't see it right now, if you've broken up, at least one person in your relationship knows it deep down. And if he ended it, that means he doesn't want to try to fix it either.

*  From adversity comes greatness. Life's biggest rewards come from the biggest challenges, or something like that

## CHAPTER ONE

*  The bright, clean, simple, easy, runs-so-smoothly-I-don't-even-have-to-think-about-it kind of works. Being the first one to recognize that a relationship isn't a match doesn't win you any great prize—just the guilt of having to hurt someone's feelings

*  The harsh reality is that even if you have everything else in common, the one thing you don't have in common is the belief that this relationship can work

*  But when you're hurting, you are not sane, and for whatever reason, often only interested in more pain.
