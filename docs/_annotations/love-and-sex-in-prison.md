*  "Love bombing is when this feels enrapturing, takes all your attention, and is excessive. It might feel great at first, but it usually leaves you isolated and makes you lose sight of who you are. Once you're swept away, this attention might stop, and will leave you feeling like you're seeking it out or chasing it down again."Â  In other words, love bombing can work a little like a drug, so initially, one wants more and more. But when it wears off, one goes crashing back to earth again.
