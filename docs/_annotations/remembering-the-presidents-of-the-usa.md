## Memory Fundamentals

*  A sound is also always sequential; if you want to remember something with sound, you have to start at the beginning and work your way through the tune of the information. However, when you see information as an image in your mind, you can visually jump in and out of it quickly and, therefore, improve your understanding too

*  Body (walking), horse (riding), car (driving), and then, finally, an airplane (flying). This makes it easy to remember the order in which they go.
