*  It has become commonplace to conclude that humans are simply irrationalâ€”more Homer Simpson than Mr. Spock, more Alfred E. Neuman than John von Neumann

*  A smartphone and a case cost $110 in total. The phone costs $100 more than the case. How much does the case cost?
   
   It takes 8 printers 8 minutes to print 8 brochures. How long would it take 24 printers to print 24 brochures?
   
   On a field there is a patch of weeds. Every day the patch doubles in size. It takes 30 days for the patch to cover the whole field. How long did it take for the patch to cover half the field?

*  The answer to the first problem is $5. If you're like most people, you guessed $10. But if that were right, the phone would cost $110 ($100 more than the case), and the total for the pair would be $120.
   
   The answer to the second question is 8 minutes. It takes a printer 8 minutes to print a brochure, so as long as there are as many printers as there are brochures and they are working simultaneously, the time it takes to print the brochures is the same.
   
   The answer to the third problem is 29 days. If the weed patch doubles every day, then by working backwards from when the field was completely covered, we may infer that it was half covered the day before.

*  And the third problem, the one with the weed patch, is not a trick question but taps a real cognitive infirmity. Human intuition doesn't grasp exponential (geometric) growth, namely something that rises at a rising rate, proportional to how large it already is, such as compound interest, economic growth, and the spread of a contagious disease
