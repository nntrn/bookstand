*  "All good thinking is play," writes Mason Hartman. She means that our best thoughts explore ideas the way a baby chimp explores the forest, with a kind of freedom and abandon. It's not a game of Parcheesi, with every move geared toward victory; rather, it's a game of make-believe, a game of "yes, and…," a game passed from generation to generation, a torch that never goes dark. "A finite game is played for the purpose of winning," wrote James Carse, "an infinite game for the purpose of continuing to play."

   Humans are not, by nature, abstract thinkers. Quite the opposite. We are creatures of the concrete: animals who experience appetites, daydreams, and dizzy spells—sometimes all at once, if the Food Network is on. We think in particulars. That's why isomorphisms matter: They transport us from one set of particulars to another. An isomorphism is an abstract bridge between islands of experience.

*  James Ernest created this matchmaking game at the request of "a middle school teacher who was looking for a good interactive classroom game on the subject of love and marriage." It requires at least 15 players, and is suitable for a nerdy party or partying classroom.
