*  None of it was real. Just all little evolutionary tips and tricksâ€”reward Juana with happiness and she'll work for what she wants. Let her love, and she'll reproduce. Let her grieve, and she'll protect. And if she wants to believe there's some kind of meaning behind it all, some reason for her existence more than a collection of molecules starting to make more of itself an eternity ago in some ancient sea, well, that's okay. She can't help it. It's the reactions in her brain.
