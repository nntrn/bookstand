*  If you want to look like a scientist, it pays to cultivate an air of certainty, but the problem with attachment to certainty is that it causes people completely to misrepresent the nature of the problem being examined, as if it were a simple physics problem rather than a psychological one. There is hence an ever-present temptation to pretend things are more 'logical' than they really are.

---

*  Robert Zion, the social psychologist, once described cognitive psychology as 'social psychology with all the interesting variables set to zero'. The point he was making is that humans are a deeply social species (which may mean that research into human behaviour or choices in artificial experiments where there is no social context isn't really all that useful).

*  The trick to being an alchemist lies not in understanding universal laws, but in spotting the many instances where those laws do not apply.

---

*  Similarly, if you expose every one of the world's problems to ostensibly logical solutions, those that can easily be solved by logic will rapidly disappear, and all that will be left are the ones that are logic-proof – those where, for whatever reason, the logical answer does not work. Most political, business, foreign policy and, I strongly suspect, marital problems seem to be of this type.

*  A rational leader suggests changing course to avoid a storm. An irrational one can change the weather.

---

*  Perhaps a plausible 'why' should not be a pre-requisite in deciding a 'what', and the things we try should not be confined to those things whose future success we can most easily explain in retrospect

---

*  Evolution is like a brilliant uneducated craftsman: what it lacks in intellect it makes up for in experience.

---

*  For instance, there are two equally potent, but completely contradictory, ways to sell a product: 'Not many people own one of these, so it must be good' and 'Lots of people already own one of these, so it must be good.'

*  While in physics the opposite of a good idea is generally a bad idea, in psychology the opposite of a good idea can be a very good idea indeed: both opposites often work.

*  In fact, we derive pleasure from 'expensive treats' and also enjoy finding 'bargains'. By contrast, the mid-range retailer offers far less of an emotional hit; you don't get a dopamine rush from mid-market purchases.

---

*  'At the federal level I am a Libertarian. At the state level, I am a Republican. At the town level, I am a Democrat. In my family I am a socialist. And with my dog I am a Marxist – from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.'

*  'What people want is a really cool vacuum cleaner.' (Dyson)
   '. . . and the best part of all this is that people will write the entire thing for free!' (Wikipedia)
   '. . . and so I confidently predict that the great enduring fashion of the next century will be a coarse, uncomfortable fabric which fades unpleasantly and which takes ages to dry. To date, it has been largely popular with indigent labourers.' (Jeans)
   '. . . and people will be forced to choose between three or four items.' (McDonald's)
   'And, best of all, the drink has a taste which consumers say they hate.' (Red Bull)
   '. . . and just watch as perfectly sane people pay $5 for a drink they can make at home for a few pence.' (Starbucks)*

*  Our mantra is 'Test counterintuitive things, because no one else ever does.' Why is this necessary? In short, the world runs on two operating systems. The much smaller of them runs on conventional logic. If you are building a bridge or building a road, there is a definition of success that is independent of perception. Will it safely take the weight of X vehicles weighing Y kg and travelling at Z mph? Success can be defined entirely in terms of objective scientific units, with no allowance for human subjectivity.

*  I did it instinctively, and was only aware of my unconscious reasoning in retrospect. 'The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing,' as Pascal put it.

*  A fascinating theory, first proposed by the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers and later supported by the evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban, explains that we do not have full access to the reasons behind our decision-making because, in evolutionary terms, we are better off not knowing; we have evolved to deceive ourselves, in order that we are better at deceiving others. Just as there are words that are best left unspoken, so there are feelings that are best left unthought.* The theory is that if all our unconscious motivations were to impinge on our consciousness, subtle cues in our behaviour might reveal our true motivation, which would limit our social and reproductive prospects.
   Robert Trivers gives an extraordinary example of a case where an animal having conscious access to its own actions may be damaging to its evolutionary fitness. When a hare is being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random and not conscious, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer.

*  The late David Ogilvy, one of the greats of the American advertising industry and the founder of the company I work for, apparently once said, 'The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think, and they don't do what they say.'

---

*  David Ogilvy's words: 'The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think, and they don't do what they say.'

*  'The economic model told me to do it' is the twenty-first-century equivalent of 'I was only following orders,' an attempt to avoid blame by denying the responsibility for one's actions.

---

*  I am not so sure that Maskelyne was a villain and instead see him as a 'typical intellectual'. I say this because we see the same pattern in a series of significant innovations – science seems to fall short of its ideals whenever the theoretical elegance of the solution or the intellectual credentials of the solver are valued above the practicality of an idea. If a problem is solved using a discipline other than that practised by those who believe themselves the rightful guardians of the solution, you'll face an uphill struggle no matter how much evidence you can amass.

*  As the novelist Upton Sinclair once remarked, 'It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'

---

*  This innovation came from the founder's flash of insight (while watching a James Bond film, no less*) that, regardless of what we say, we are much bothered by the uncertainty of waiting than by the duration of a wait

*  And yet we spend very little money and time looking for psychological solutions, partly because, in attempting to understand why people do things, we have a tendency to default to the rational explanation whenever there is one. As we saw with Maskelyne's response to Harrison's nautical innovation, the people at the top of organisations are largely rational decision makers who are naturally disparaging of psychological solutions. But it also comes from our urge to depict our behaviour in as high-minded a way as we can manage, hiding our unconscious motivations beneath a rational facade.

---

*  But just because there is a rational answer to something, it doesn't mean that there isn't a more interesting, irrational answer to be found in the unconscious.

---

*  In general, people are impressed by any visible extra effort that goes into a product: if you simply say 'this washing powder is better than our old powder', it is a hollow claim. However, if you replace the powder with a gel, a tablet or some other form, the cost and effort which have gone into the change make it more plausible to the purchaser there may have been some real innovation in the new contents.

---

*  However, the problem will never go away, because the number of people who think they understand statistics dangerously dwarfs those who actually do, and maths can cause fundamental problems when badly used.

*  And it's a finding that has great implications for the behavioural sciences, because it suggests that many supposed biases which economists wish to correct may not be biases at all – they may simply arise from the fact that a decision which seems irrational when viewed through an ensemble perspective is rational when viewed through the correct time-series perspective, which is how real life is actually lived; what happens on average when a thousand people do something once is not a clue to what will happen when one person does something a thousand times.

---

*  The quandary is that you can either create a fairer, more equitable society, with opportunities for all but where luck plays a significant role, or you can create a society which maintains the illusion of complete and non-random fairness, yet where opportunities are open to only a few – the problem is that when 'the rules are the same for everyone' the same boring bastards win every time

*  By applying identical criteria to everyone in the name of fairness, you end up recruiting identical people

---

*  Metrics, and especially averages, encourage you to focus on the middle of a market, but innovation happens at the extremes. You are more likely to come up with a good idea focusing on one outlier than on ten average users.

*  Weird consumers drive more innovation than normal ones

---

*  It's true that 'what gets measured gets managed', but the concomitant truth is 'what gets mismeasured gets mismanaged'

*  One great problem with metrics is that they destroy diversity because they force everybody to pursue the same narrow goal, often in the same narrow way, or to make choices using the exact same criteria

*  One of the other problems with a logically consistent system for hiring people is that ambitious middle-class people can exploit it by 'gaming the system'

*  Nassim Nicholas Taleb applies this rule to choosing a doctor: you don't want the smooth, silver-haired patrician who looks straight out of central casting – you want his slightly overweight, less patrician but equally senior colleague in the ill-fitting suit. The former has become successful partly as a result of his appearance, the latter despite it.

---

*  It reported on three studies which examined what happens when you change the finalists for a job. The research revealed that: 'When there is only one woman, she does not stand a chance of being hired, but that changes dramatically when there is more than one.

---

*  Usually someone has often already found an answer to your problem – just in a different domain.

---

*  Firstly, it doesn't always pay to be logical if everyone else is also being logical.

---

*  Geim knows it is far more common for a mixture of luck, experimentation and instinctive guesswork to provide the decisive breakthrough; reason only comes into play afterwards

*  Business people and politicians do not quite understand this and tend to evaluate decisions by the rigour of the process that produces them, rather than by the rigour with which you evaluate their consequences.

---

*  Wine tastes better when poured from a heavier bottle. Painkillers are more effective when people believe they are expensive. Almost everything becomes more desirable when people believe it is in scarce supply, and possessions become more enjoyable when they have a famous brand name attached.

---

*  The invention of the 'designated driver' was an even cleverer use of semantics and naming to create a social good. The phrase, meaning the person who is nominated to stay sober in order to drive his friends home safely, was a deliberate coinage that spread with the active support of Hollywood who agreed to use it in selected episodes of popular sitcoms and dramas.

*  It is interesting to consider how many more benign behaviours might be made possible through semantic invention. I have always thought, for instance, that the word 'downsizing', which is used not only as a euphemism for redundancies, but in another sense refers to the voluntary decision by 'empty nesters' to move to a smaller and more manageable home, is a very useful coinage. It allows older people in needlessly large homes to portray their move to a smaller house as a choice born out of preference, rather than – as it may otherwise be assumed to be – a compromise born of financial necessity. Create a name, and you've created a norm.*

---

*  By reducing the possible applications of the device to a single use, it clarified what the device was for. The technical design term for this is an 'affordance', a word that deserves to be more widely known. As Don Norman observes:
   'The term affordance refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used. [. . .] Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things. Plates are for pushing. Knobs are for turning. Slots are for inserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction needed.'

*  However, all I can rely on here for evidence is a recurrent pattern of events – it is surprisingly common for significant innovations to emerge from the removal of features rather than the addition. Google is, to put it bluntly, Yahoo without all the extraneous crap cluttering up the search page, while Yahoo was, in its day, AOL without in-built Internet access. In each case, the more successful competitor achieved their dominance by removing something the competitor offered rather than adding to it.

*  However, the engineering mentality – as at Sony – runs counter to this; the idea of removing functionality seems completely illogical, and it is extremely hard to make the case for over-riding conventional logic in any business or government setting, unless you are the chairman, chief executive or minister in charge. Although you may think that people instinctively want to make the best possible decision, there is a stronger force that animates business decision-making: the desire not to get blamed or fired. The best insurance against blame is to use conventional logic in every decision.

---

*  There is the 'tourist restaurant' approach, where you try to make as much money from people in a single visit. And then there is the 'local pub' approach, where you may make less money from people on each visit, but where you will profit more over time by encouraging them to come back.

*  Likewise, when your company pays your salary each month, it says you are worth that money for now; when it sends you on an expensive training course, it signals that it is committed to you for at least a few years.

---

*  'Credo quia absurdum est', said Saint Augustine, supposedly – 'I believe it because it is ridiculous.' He was talking about Christianity, but it is equally true of many other facets of life: we attach meaning to things precisely because they deviate from what seems sensible.

---

*  Effective communication will always require some degree of irrationality in its creation because if it's perfectly rational it becomes, like water, entirely lacking in flavour

*  Quite simply, all powerful messages must contain an element of absurdity, illogicality, costliness, disproportion, inefficiency, scarcity, difficulty or extravagance – because rational behaviour and talk, for all their strengths, convey no meaning

*  One of the most important ideas in this book is that it is only by deviating from a narrow, short-term self-interest that we can generate anything more than cheap talk. It is therefore impossible to generate trust, affection, respect, reputation, status, loyalty, generosity or sexual opportunity by simply pursuing the dictates of rational economic theory. If rationality were valuable in evolutionary terms, accountants would be sexy. Male strippers dress as firemen, not accountants; bravery is sexy, but rationality isn't. Can this theory be extended further? For instance, is poetry more moving than prose because it is more difficult to write?* And is music more emotionally potent than normal speech because it is more difficult to sing than to talk?*

---

*  Information is free, but sincerity is not, and it isn't only humans who attach significance to messages in proportion to the costliness of their creation and transmission; bees also do it.*

---

*  In many ways, expensive advertising and brands arise as a solution to a problem identified by George Akerlof in his 1970 paper 'The Market for Lemons' in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. The problem is known as 'information asymmetry', whereby the seller knows more about what he is selling than the buyer knows about what he is buying. This lesson was learned the hard way in Eastern Bloc countries under communism; brands were considered un-Marxist, so bread was simply labelled 'bread'. Customers had no idea who had made it or whom to blame if it arrived full of maggots, and couldn't avoid that make in future if it did, because all bread packaging looked the same. Unhappy customers had no threat of sanction; happy customers had no prospect of rewarding producers through repeat custom. And so the bread was rubbish.

*  My analogy between signalling in the biological world and advertising in the commercial world may explain something I have noticed for years: if you talk to economists, they tend to hate advertising and barely understand it at all, while if you talk to biologists they understand it perfectly.

*  The psychologist Nicholas Humphrey argues that placebos work by prompting the body to invest more resources in its recovery.* He believes that evolution has calibrated our immune system to suit a harsher environment than the current one, so we need to convince our unconscious that the conditions for recovery are especially favourable in order for our immune system to work at full tilt.

*  The placebo effect, like many other forms of alchemy, is an attempt to influence the mind or body's automatic processes. Our unconscious, specifically our 'adaptive unconscious' as psychologist Timothy Wilson calls it in Strangers to Ourselves (2002), does not notice or process information in the same way we do consciously, and does not speak the same language that our consciousness does, but it holds the reins when it comes to much of our behaviour. This means that we often cannot alter subconscious processes through a direct logical act of will – we instead have to tinker with those things we can control to influence those things we can't or manipulate our environment to create conditions conducive to an emotional state which we cannot will into being

*  There is a good evolutionary reason why we are imbued with these strong, involuntary feelings: feelings can be inherited, whereas reasons have to be taught, which means that evolution can select for emotions much more reliably than for reasons.

---

*  To recalibrate our immune response to levels appropriate to the more benign conditions we experience in everyday modern life, it may be necessary to deploy some benign bullshit.* This, I suppose, was what my grandfather was doing in the days before antibiotics, when he cheered up his patients with banter and encouraged them to wrap up warmly, stay in bed, feed themselves well and drink medicinal whiskies – perhaps prescribing for good measure some ineffectual pills that nonetheless created enough of an illusion of optimism for the patient's body to enter 'healing mode'.

---

*  Take the control panels in elevators. One of the buttons found on them, the 'door close' button, is quite interesting, because on many (and perhaps most) elevators, it is actually a placebo button – it is connected to nothing at all. It is there simply to make impatient people feel better by giving them something to do and the illusion of control. It is, in effect, a civilised alternative to a punchbag.

---

*  One of Nicholas Humphrey's rules about what makes an effective placebo is that there must be some effort, scarcity or expense involved

---

*  Red Bull is among the most successful commercial placebos ever produced – its powers at hacking the unconscious are so great that it is repeatedly studied by psychologists and behavioural economists all over the world, including the great Pierre Chandon at INSEAD, one of the top business schools in Europe

*  The most plausible explanation for the incredible success of Red Bull lies in a kind of placebo effect. After all, it shares many of the features of a great placebo: it's expensive, it tastes weird and it comes in a 'restricted dose'. In its early days, Red Bull also benefited from repeated rumours that its active ingredient, taurine, was about to be banned

---

*  It seems rather like the lesson that is taught to aspiring journalists: 'Dog Bites Man' is not news, but 'Man Bites Dog' is. Meaning is disproportionately conveyed by things that are unexpected or illogical, while narrowly logical things convey no information at all. And this brings us full circle, to the explanation of costly signalling.
