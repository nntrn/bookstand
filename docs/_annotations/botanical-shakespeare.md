*  Lawyers claim Shakespeare was a lawyer, doctors think he was medically trained, actors assume he was a thespian, soldiers, sailors, and astronomers all claim a kindred spirit. So it should be no surprise that knowledgeable gardeners think the Bard's extensive use of botanical references would qualify him as a Master Gardener.
   Playwright Ben Jonson, Shakespeare's eulogist of sorts, said he was "not of an Age, but for all Time."
