## 1 He’s Just Not That Into You If He’s Not Asking You Out

*  Give me a call." "E-mail me." "Tell Joey we should all hang out sometime." Don't let him trick you into asking him out.

## 2 He’s Just Not That Into You If He’s Not Calling You

*  The word "busy" is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word "busy" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact, in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember: Men are never too busy to get what they want.

*  Meeting someone you like and dating him is supposed to make you feel better, not worse.
