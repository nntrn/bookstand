*  The zombie is a noun that's devoured a verb: implementation, assessment, authorization, documentation, participation, transmittal, realization… all zombies

*  Helen Sword, a professor at the University of Auckland, is the creator of the more vivid term, a scary noun we will want to treat with circumspection (sic). "I call them 'zombie nouns,'" she writes, "because they cannibalize active verbs, suck the lifeblood from adjectives and substitute abstract entities for human beings."

*  The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency toward pomposity and abstraction.
   
   Seven zombies inhabit that sentence, the offspring of five verbs and two adjectives. Ms. Sword eliminates or reanimates most of the zombie nouns, adds a human subject, and the sentence springs to life:
   
   Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract

*  When he wrote that essay, container shipping, leading to containerize and the zombie containerization, had not arrived, but Ms. Sword brings us grimly up to date with what happens when zombies "gather in jargon-generating packs and infect every noun, verb and adjective in sight." We began with globe (1551) which became global (1676), then globalize (1953), and since 1961 we've enjoyed globalization. The most scary combination is a sentence in the passive voice infiltrated by a zombie; the sentence can become two or three times as long.

*  If you cannot understand my argument, and declare "It's Greek to me," you are quoting Shakespeare; if you claim to be more sinned against than sinning, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you recall your salad days, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you act more in sorrow than in anger; if your wish is father to the thought; if your lost property has vanished into thin air, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you have ever refused to budge an inch or suffered from green-eyed jealousy, if you have played fast and loose, if you have been tongue-tied, a tower of strength, hoodwinked or in a pickle, if you have knitted your brows, made a virtue of necessity, insisted on fair play, slept not one wink, stood on ceremony, danced attendance (on your lord and master), laughed yourself into stitches, had short shrift, cold comfort or too much of a good thing, if you have seen better days or lived in a fool's paradise—why, be that as it may, the more fool you, for it is a foregone conclusion that you are (as good luck would have it) quoting Shakespeare; if you think it is early days and clear out bag and baggage, if you think it is high time and that that is the long and short of it, if you believe that the game is up and that truth will out even if it involves your own flesh and blood, if you lie low till the crack of doom because you suspect foul play, if you have your teeth set on edge (at one fell swoop) without rhyme or reason, then—to give the devil his due—if the truth were known (for surely you have a tongue in your head) you are quoting Shakespeare; even if you bid me good riddance and send me packing, if you wish I was dead as a doornail, if you think I am an eyesore, a laughing stock, the devil incarnate, a stony-hearted villain, bloody-minded or a blinking idiot, then—by Jove! O Lord! Tut tut! For goodness' sake! What the dickens! But me no buts!—it is all one to me, for you are quoting Shakespeare.
