## Chapter 1 - The Law of Pure Potentiality

*  The experience of the Self, or "self-referral," means that our internal reference point is our own spirit, and not the objects of our experience.

*  Your true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is completely free of those things. It is immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is also humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the same Self, the same spirit in different disguises.

*  It draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you

*  "Today I shall judge nothing that occurs."

*  When you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself with the world of energy â€” the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of the material world.
