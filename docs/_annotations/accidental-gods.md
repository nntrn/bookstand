*  Gods are born ex nihilo and out of lotuses, from the white blood of the sea-foam, or the earwax of a bigger god. They are also birthed on dining room tables and when spectacles of power are taken too far. They are born when men find themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time. Gods are made in sudden deaths, violent accidents; they ascend in the smoke of a pyre, or wait, in their tombs, for offerings of cigars.

*  Gods are made when language goes beyond its intentions. Occasionally, a god is born out of an excess of love. As the third-century theologian Origen wrote, in his commentary on the Song of Songs, "It should be known that it is impossible for human nature not always to love something." It is also impossible for human nature not to love too much.
