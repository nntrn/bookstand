*  The mathematician knows that he owes to the natural sciences his most important stimulations. At times the mathematician has the passion of a poet or a conqueror, the rigour of his arguments is that of a responsible statesman or more simply, of a concerned father, and his tolerance and resignation are those of an old sage; he is revolutionary and conservative, sceptical and yet faithfully optimistic.
