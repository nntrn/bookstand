*  Twenty years later, I can tell you that clarity comes from making decisions that are aligned with your core beliefs and values.

*  I'm inspired by this quote from IBM founder Thomas J. Watson:
   
   IBM is what it is today for three special reasons. The first reason is that, at the very beginning, I had a very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was finally done. You might say I had a model in my mind of what it would look like when the dream—my vision—was in place.
   The second reason was that once I had that picture, I then asked myself how a company that looked like that would have to act. I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was finally done.
   The third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would look when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that, unless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there.
   In other words, I realized that for IBM to become a great company it would have to act like a great company long before it ever became one.

*  Ray Dalio said, "I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones."

*  What it all boils down to is that alignment is the key to fulfillment. Keep these things in mind:
   
   Your vision must align with who you want to be.
   Your choices must align with your vision.
   Your effort must align with the size of your vision.
   Your behavior must align with your values and principles.
