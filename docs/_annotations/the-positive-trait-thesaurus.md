*  Character strengths aid us in fulfilling our needs and desires and encouraging self-growth, while weaknesses often hold us back. In some situations, it can be difficult to tell a weakness from a strength, especially since flaws may form out of an understandable desire to keep us from being hurt.

---

*  Who is this character and what makes me care about him enough to write his story? Jot down notes about his quirks, attitudes, morals, and beliefs to get a sense of who he is, using this thesaurus for inspiration. Delve into his backstory. Who hurt him and why? Who showed him love or made him feel like he belonged? What challenges did he face that hardened him or weakened him? Once you have a good idea of who he is, then ask yourself: Based on what I know about this person, what is the worst thing that could happen to him?

---

*  The interesting thing about characters is that, like real people, if you put them all in the same situation, they will react differently. Even those who share the same attribute will respond in distinctive ways due to the combination of traits they possess.

---

*  Without imminent danger, even primal stakes cease to be compelling

*  Reader concern for the hero often stems from the unconscionable nature of the bad guy. But if the character opposing the hero isn't terrifying, then the stakes don't seem quite so desperate. To make sure this doesn't happen, do your homework. Map out the villain's character arc so you're aware of what he wants and why he's so desperate to achieve it

---

*  Because creative types tend to focus on their gifts, they may be somewhat out of touch with reality. This can lead to awkwardness or insecurity in social situations. Their focus on the muse can distract them from day-to-day practicalities, like housecleaning, paying the bills, and grocery shopping. The need to create can become so all-consuming that it leads to the neglect of important relationships, bringing about isolation. The path to creation is also rife with naysayers, turning some creative characters negative and jaded or instigating thoughts of self-doubt that lead to depression.

---

*  Difficulty paying attention on a task if something more interesting is present

*  Curious characters are drawn to problems or inconveniences that other people would choose to avoid. Their curiosity can make them adventurous, spurring them on to do things others wouldn't do. They are often knowledgeable, either in a general way or about something specific.

*  Curious characters are often impulsive, acting without thinking. They can be single-minded to a faultâ€”focusing on their pursuit (or being hopelessly distracted) and following whatever rabbit trail appears before them. Those who are curious are frequently more interested in their current topic of exploration than their relationships and may not understand or appreciate those without a similar level of curiosity.

*  CHALLENGING SCENARIOS FOR THE CURIOUS CHARACTER:
   Dealing with people who are protective of their knowledge
   Living in a society where free thinking is discouraged
   Being given tasks that require strict attention and focus
   Working with people who lack drive or the desire to explore

---

*  POSITIVE ASPECTS: Easygoing characters are comfortable to be around. They're laid-back and take life as it comes. Rather than stress over things that are out of their control, they go with the flow and enjoy the positives. Characters with this trait don't worry about winning or losing or chasing success; they simply enjoy the experience.

*  NEGATIVE ASPECTS: Easygoing characters don't always have the same priorities as other people. Their mellow approach to life may lead others to believe that they're apathetic or lack passion. Being easygoing means not being concerned with things that may be important to others, like punctuality, orderliness, or ambition. This difference in priorities can cause conflict with characters who value such things.

---

*  Striving to balance honesty and tact

---

*  Idealistic characters are valued for their honesty, their ability to listen, and their genuine, caring natures. They make strong peacemakers and advisors by ignoring the fluff, focusing instead on the heart of a problem and what it will take to make those involved more happy and fulfilled. They are resilient and determined when it comes to their convictions and cannot easily be brought down by disappointment or failure. These characters have big dreams and the courage to chase them, which often leads to change for the better.

*  While they're able to easily visualize the big picture, idealists sometimes have a hard time ironing out the details. Their inability to see how to make the dream a reality on a practical level can frustrate both them and the people dedicated to helping them succeed.

---

*  Objective characters do well in an advisor's role because they are able to separate emotions from a volatile situation and proceed logically. When problems arise, they will go to great lengths to come up with a solution that is fair, based on the facts presented. Others respect that these characters take the time to investigate and gather information when making decisions. By being impartial, even when family or friends are involved, the advice of an objective character usually holds a lot of weight.

*  Amy Farrah Fowler from The Big Bang Theory is naturally objective, which suits her as a neurobiologist. She has a strong handle on her emotions and asks questions to get to the root of the issue at hand. Highly observant, she acts based on information and proven truth rather than being swayed by intuition or emotion.

---

*  Knowing oneself accurately and intimately

*  Being logical yet having good intuition

*  Although his fellow travelers at first are put off by his strangeness, they eventually come to respect his insight and rely on his input

---

*  Continually making comparisons and evaluating

*  Philosophical characters read deeply into situations and aren't afraid of intellectual heavy lifting in order to find answers. Well-educated and thoughtful, when they share what is on their minds, they can provoke curiosity in others and encourage them to probe harder to resolve their own unanswered questions. These characters have a lot of wisdom, and while they won't dole it out quickly, they are excellent sounding boards for friends or family who need to work through problems.

*  These characters can sometimes find themselves alienated from life itself, for as they quest for answers, they can forget to experience the world firsthand. Friends and family may view them as silent, brooding types, or feel that they overthink everything. Philosophical characters can have hobbies that most people don't get or aren't interested in, and they tend to have fewer relationships because of the importance solitude plays in puzzling out life's big mysteries. They can also be long-winded when imparting ideas, causing impatience or boredom.

---

*  Being amused when others are discomfited by one's uniqueness
   Sticking to one's individuality despite opposition
   Being open-minded
   Enjoying life
   Doing even mundane tasks a little differently than others
   Defying the norm
   Being annoyed when others follow trends and jump on popular bandwagons
   Espousing beliefs and opinions that are different from the mainstream

---

*  Simple characters are often happy to stay in the background, increasing the likelihood of their being overlooked. If they have something to say, it's usually important or insightful, although others may not listen or trust their wisdom because of their unassuming natures. Their desire to keep things simple means they're often reluctant to get involved in initiatives or try new experiences, which robs them of opportunities that could lead to greater satisfaction and happiness.

---

*  Witty characters make observations that can turn mundane situations or events into hilarity. These characters are often the first to make a joke and can elevate an existing quip by adding another layer of observation, carrying the humor farther. Quick-thinking, witty folks deliver one-liners which are both clever and eye-opening, allowing others to experience a situation's meaning at a different level, often through the lens of irony

*  Characters with a quick wit can sometimes let their mouths get ahead of their good sense, offering humor when it isn't wanted or needed or joking in a way that makes people uncomfortable. Some characters who are enthralled with their own wittiness can veer into caustic wit and sarcasm, which can hurt or humiliate others. There is also the chance that an observation about a group or belief could unknowingly touch on a sensitive subject and offend listeners. In addition, people can be turned off by a witty character's constant one-upmanship.
