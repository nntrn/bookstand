*  Let's talk about solar energy first. Solar energy is first and foremost very destructive to the environment to make. The manufacturing of the panels creates an enormous amount of greenhouse gas from silicon. Silicon is first mined from quartz and then heated in a furnace to make it usable, which emits toxic sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The mining and transportation of the panels are also not good for the environment and cost a huge amount of energy to be completed. Then when solar panels need to be disposed of, the process is also incredibly difficult, costly, and environmentally unsafe
