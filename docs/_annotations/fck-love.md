## Chapter 1: F*ck Charisma

*  What to Look For
   What to Achieve/What Not to Be Fooled By

## Five Reasons Good People Can’t Find Good Partners

*  You're a woman: That's right—from haircuts to health care, being a woman is expensive, but your gender is also costing you a decent chance at finding a partner. That's because there are more marriage-qualified women than marriage-qualified men

*  You connect too easily or hang on too long: You'd think that being a gifted bonder would help if you're looking for lasting love, but not if you attach too easily to people you don't know well or hang on too long to partners who are obvious wastes of time. So you spend too much time talking to, caring for, and dating people who may be nice but aren't your cup of tea. Then, after the breakup, you're not just heartbroken, but are too exhausted and burned-out to get out there and search for someone worthwhile

## Chapter 2: F*ck Beauty

*  If, after beginning a relationship with someone beautiful, your anxiety doesn't get better, you may well feel you're about to ruin something special. In actuality, however, anxiety doesn't mean a relationship is flawed or doomed to fail; it's a normal and potentially helpful response to the reality that all relationships carry risk, that falling in love can cause heartbreak, and that a bad marriage can cause much worse. So instead of fearing that anxiety will ruin things, give yourself credit for courage, go slow, and keep trying to find things you both enjoy doing and talking about.

*  If she can't trust the mirror, she can't trust logic; no matter how honest and positive you are with your girlfriend, it isn't going to help.
