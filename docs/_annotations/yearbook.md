## Bubby and Zaidy

*  Nobody wants to hear about what you like. There's nothing less funny than hearing about the stuff you have fun doing. Fun isn't funny. Comedy is pain. It's struggle. So, when thinking of what to write about, don't ask yourself, "What's funny to me?" Ask yourself, "What bothers me? What frustrates me? What do I wish I could change? What can I just not fucking stand?!"
