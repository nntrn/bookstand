*  By the seventeenth century, the word "lobster" had even developed a derogatory usage in speechâ€”calling someone a lobster was like calling him a rascal. One English source from 1609 gives an example: "you whorson Lobster." During the American revolution, the word was a put-down for British redcoats, and in American slang of the late 1800s it was used to call someone a dupe or a fool.
