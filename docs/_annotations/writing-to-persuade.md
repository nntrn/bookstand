*  A former hedge-fund trader named Sam Polk once sent a draft of an article dealing with his wealth addiction

*  Tim Kreider, an essayist and cartoonist who frequently contributes to the Times, wrote about his passion for his cat—a piece that was later selected for a book on the best essays of the year.

*  All of us have stories to tell. The strongest ones, the ones that people will remember, often reveal something almost painfully personal even as they connect to a larger issue or story that feels both universal and urgent

---

*  Don't tell people how to feel, or not feel, or whoever you're talking to will stop talking. Start by giving people a chance to explain their ideas and feelings, and you will seem agreeable and willing to listen. Cut them off, and you will never persuade them of anything.

*  What liberals should read and watch to understand the other viewpoint:
   
   The Wall Street Journal editorial page
   
   The National Review
   
   The Federalist 
   
   Drudge
   
   Fox News 
   
   What conservatives should read to understand the other viewpoint:
   
   The New Yorker
   
   Slate
   
   The New York Times
   
   Politico
   
   The Washington Post

*  That is a classic approach: If you think this, why do you also think something that appears to be the opposite? Pointing out a contradiction might make your audience look at an issue differently. Sometimes showing that you understand your audience is simple. Just start your essay by telling them that you know what sorts of things they worry about, because you worry about the same things.

---

*  If you establish commonality and then bring up an issue that might be a source of disagreement, your audience is much more willing to listen because of the connection you have already made. Research by psychologists has confirmed and reconfirmed that phenomenon. By agreeing with your audience, you're much more likely to change their minds, as counterintuitive as that might sound.

*  "Monkey see, monkey do" is a powerful phrase, but the see part is really important.

---

*  They drive our rational conclusions, in the sense that the conclusions are just an excuse to justify the feelings

*  Being optimistic—or slightly in denial—is an evolutionary advantage. It makes us psychologically able to keep venturing into the world, taking risks, and believing in the future. (But it also makes us a bit stupid about things we ought to do, like saving for retirement and scheduling unpleasant medical tests like colonoscopies.)

*  In your persuasive writing, remember that scaring people and being negative does not generally agree with our fundamental natures. We are hardwired for optimism, so we generally respond better to positive messages than negative ones.

---

*  You have to be nonjudgmental to establish that rapport. You have to lose any desire to dominate and instead, create the feeling that you are in a partnership.

*  And if you're in a one-on-one situation, it's important to make clear that the other person doesn't owe you anything

---

*  Generalizing about people is a major way to be hostile in writing. It's aggravating and off-putting when writers take a stance that all poor people are lazy, all white people are bad; all men, predators; and all women, kind and gentle. You get the idea.

---

*  People are attracted to stories about disaster, about facing adversity and overcoming challenges, about conflict and self-doubt, and about connections made despite some kind of obstacle.
