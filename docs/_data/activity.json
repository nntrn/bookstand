    "text": "How Happiness Gives Your Brain–and Your Organization–the Competitive Edge\nIn 1543, Nicolas Copernicus published De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolution of Celestial Spheres). Until then, most of the world had believed that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun revolved around the planet. But Copernicus famously argued that precisely the opposite was true—Earth revolved around the sun—a revelation that eventually changed the way humans saw the entire universe.\nToday, a similar fundamental shift in the field of psychology is underway. For untold generations, we have been led to believe that happiness orbited around success. That if we work hard enough, we will be successful, and only if we are successful will we become happy. Success was thought to be the fixed point of the work universe, with happiness revolving around it. Now, thanks to breakthroughs in the burgeoning field of positive psychology, we are learning that the opposite is true. When we are happy—when our mindset and mood are positive—we are smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it.\nUnfortunately, despite the decades of research that tell us otherwise, many businesses and their leaders still cling stubbornly to their belief in this flawed order. The ruling powers continue to tell us that if we just put our nose to the grindstone and work hard now, we will be successful, and therefore happier, in some distant future. As we work toward our goals, happiness is either irrelevant or an easily dispensable luxury or a reward only to be won after a lifetime of toil. Some even treat it as a weakness, a sign that we’re not working hard enough. Every time we fall for this misguided creed, we undercut not only our mental and emotional well-being, but also our chances at success and achievement.\nThe most successful people, the ones with the competitive edge, don’t look to happiness as some distant reward for their achievements, nor grind through their days on neutral or negative; they are the ones who capitalize on the positive and reap the rewards at every turn. This chapter will show you how they do it, why it works, and how you, too, can profit. In its own way, the Happiness Advantage, too, is a Copernican revolution—it shows us that success orbits around happiness, not the other way around.\nDEFINING HAPPINESS\nNo one would talk to me. I was minutes away from speaking about the connection between happiness and performance at work to a group of executives from the Korean company Samsung, just waiting for the HR manager to introduce me to the room. I usually enjoy getting to know people during this brief interlude before a talk, but on this day all the managers were staring ahead blankly, ignoring my repeated attempts at conversation. So I dejectedly pretended to fix my PowerPoint presentation (a surefire tactic for avoiding social awkwardness in these situations, though it works less well at cocktail parties). Finally, someone entered the room and introduced himself as Brian, the leader of the group. That’s when I learned that the planners of the event had forgotten to mention one small detail: No one spoke any English.\nAs it turns out, the translator Samsung usually hired for these occasions was out sick, so Brian offered to translate for me. As we began, he leaned over and confided, “I’m not great with languages.”\nFor the next three hours, I spoke in one-minute bursts, turning after each one to my “translator,” who would proceed to either look very confused, or animatedly start speaking to the group, usually for about three minutes longer than I had. I have no idea how accurately he was translating, but I do know he got all the credit for my jokes. Given how bumpy this process was, I decided to stop talking and instead encourage the executives to talk to one another. “To study how happiness affects performance,” I said, “we need a definition. So that’s the question I pose to you: What is happiness?” Pleased with my little last-minute exercise, I waited for Brian to translate what I had just said. Instead, he looked confused and leaned toward me. “You don’t know what happiness means?” he asked nervously.\nMy face froze. “No, I’m saying I’d like the group to come up with a definition of happiness.”\nHe covered his microphone and leaned in again, clearly trying not to embarrass me. “I can Google it for you.”\nTHE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS\nWhile I was appreciative of the offer, not even the all-knowing Google has a definitive answer to this question. That’s because there is no single meaning; happiness is relative to the person experiencing it. This is why scientists often refer to it as “subjective well-being”—because it’s based on how we each feel about our own lives. In essence, the best judge of how happy you are is you. To empirically study happiness, then, scientists must rely on individual self-reports. Thankfully, after years of testing and honing survey q",

After this case was reported another 700 officers in the same force came forward to complain about the standard-issue protective vest. But although the complaints have been coming regularly over the past twenty years, little seems to have been done. British female police officers report being bruised by their kit belts; a number have had to have physiotherapy as a result of the way stab vests sit on their female body; many complain there is no space for their breasts. This is not only uncomfortable, it also results in stab vests coming up too short, leaving women unprotected. Which rather negates the whole point of wearing one.",

Findings like this—which go back to at least 1799—have dispelled the myth that the Egyptians were the ultimate cat lovers. The truth is darker.\nThe Egyptians used their cats for ritual offerings and sacrifice. That’s why they were considered sacred. In mimetic theory, there is a near-indissoluble link between chaos and order, violence and the sacred. Sacrificial rites—whether sacrificing cats in ancient Egypt or the ritual firing of coaches and CEOs today—are the mechanism by which mimetic contagion is contained and controlled.\nThe fourth and final stage of the mimetic cycle, which we turn to now, is the process by which chaotic desires become orderly desires in human societies: the scapegoat mechanism.",

Physiologists study how the smells are carried to the sensory cells in the nose by our breathing in, as when inhaling the aroma of a cup of coffee, and by breathing out, as when we chew and swallow our food. Psychologists study how smell is combined with taste and the other senses to produce what is called taste but is really flavor, one of the most complex of human sensations. Cognitive neuroscientists use brain imaging to show how flavor arises from activity at the highest cognitive levels of our brains. Neuropharmacologists study how the regions of the brain that are activated by cravings for food involve some of the same regions that are activated by cravings for tobacco, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. Biochemists identify the hormones that circulate in the blood, connecting our bodies with our brains to signal to start eating when we are hungry and stop when we are full. Anthropologists speculate that cooked food was a major driving force in human evolution. Molecular biologists have discovered that the sensory receptors for smell form the largest gene family in the genome, and they are studying how the molecules give rise to our perceptions of different smells. And we are good smellers: behavioral psychologists find that monkeys as well as humans have much more sensitive senses of smell than previously recognized.",

But then they discovered a wrinkle. That finding is true only when the threat comes from outside the relationship, as in the study above. When it comes from inside, the responses are different. Both secure and avoidant people can stay on topic and keep their emotions in check while discussing internal conflicts—say, the fact that one partner wants more sex than the other—although secure folks are still better at constructing solutions and acting warmly toward their partner. But in the face of internal conflict, anxious partners do not reach out; they go completely off the rails. They catastrophize, bring in irrelevant issues, and become angry and confrontational, even when their partner refrains from being reciprocally hostile. Anxious partners are generally uneasy about their lover’s commitment to begin with and thus are primed to view anything he or she says or does more negatively. Haunted by the specter of abandonment, they try to control their lover.",

These are wired in by thousands of years of evolution.

Because strokes are essential to a person’s survival, the exchange of strokes is one of the most important activities people engage in. Strokes can vary from actual physical stroking to praise, or just recognition. To be effective, a stroke must be suited to its recipient. For example, Spitz1 has shown that a very young child needs actual physical stroking to survive. On the other hand, adults may require only occasional, symbolic strokes such as praise, or an expression of appreciation, to remain alive. However, while it is possible to survive on minimal strokes, stroke scarcity is unhealthy both physically and emotionally; thus stroke hunger is a major driving force in people.",

In the same period, philosopher René Descartes propounded notions of dualism, the idea that the human mind and body were distinct spheres and, by extension, that animals were incapable of reason. And in the eighteenth century, philosopher Immanuel Kant characterized humans, who wield agency and reason, as distinctively moral beings. In contrast, philosopher David Hume separated humans from the natural world based not on our capacity to reason about or observe nature but on our capacity to sympathize.",

He describes hostile and erotic impulses to people who actually exhibit minimal signs of a corresponding unconscious impulse. Since everyone has hostile impulses … it is not difficult for the selectively hypersensitive paranoid to find persons on whom to project. Thus there is always a core of truth in paranoid accusations.” Here Cameron, in typically convoluted psychiatric jargon, states (only to let it pass) the most important fact about paranoia: namely, stated in my words, that paranoia is a state of heightened awareness",

One day he decided to see what would happen if he placed a piece of mutton in his potato drying machine. Would the taste be different if the meat were cooked at this lower temperature? He checked on the mutton three hours later and saw that it showed no signs of being done and concluded that the heat was not sufficiently intense. He abandoned the experiment, telling the maids to cook the mutton properly. Apparently they forgot about the meat until the next morning and when they checked on it, they discovered that it had been perfectly cooked despite the fact that the fire that had supplied the heat had gone out during the night. Rumford was delighted and the concept of slow cooking at low temperature was born. The sous-vide method, currently championed by many chefs can be traced back to this fortuitous discovery made by Count Rumford.",

Starting with the most basic, the calorie count on treadmills is perfect for practically no one, but it will be more accurate for your average man because its calculations are based on the average male weight (the default setting for calorie count on most exercise machines is for a person who weighs eleven stone). And although you can change the weight setting, that still leaves a calculation based on an average male calorie burn. Women generally have a higher fat and lower muscle distribution than men as well as different ratios of various muscle fibres. What this means at a basic level is that even after accounting for weight difference, men on average will burn 8% more calories than a woman of the same weight.

[Warmth]\n\tCan I respect this person? [Strength]\n\t\n\tCuddy found that people looked for answers to these questions, in that order—once again, because of primal survival instincts.

    "text": "One of the peculiar features of history is that time always erodes advantage. Every invention sooner or later leads to a counterinvention. Every success contains the seeds of its own overthrow. Every hegemony comes to an end. Evolutionary history is no different. Progress and success are always relative. When the land was unoccupied by animals, the first amphibian to emerge from the sea could get away with being slow, lumbering, and fishlike, for it had no enemies and no competitors. But if a fish were to take to the land today, it would be gobbled up by a passing fox as surely as a Mongol horde would be wiped out by machine guns. In history and in evolution, progress is always a futile, Sisyphean struggle to stay in the same relative place by getting ever better at things. Cars move through the congested streets of London no faster than horse-drawn carriages did a century ago. Computers have no effect on productivity because people learn to complicate and repeat tasks that have been made easier.\nThis concept, that all progress is relative, has come to be known in biology by the name of the Red Queen, after a chess piece that Alice meets in Through the Looking-Glass, who perpetually runs without getting very far because the landscape moves with her. It is an increasingly influential idea in evolutionary theory, and one that will recur throughout the book. The faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progress. Life is a chess tournament in which if you win a game, you start the next game with the handicap of a missing pawn.",

Once he commits himself to his course of action, he does not expect to come out of it alive. He will generally either kill himself after he’s “made his statement” or commit what we call “suicide by cop”—forcing a confrontation in which the police or SWAT team will have no choice but to open fire. I expect that later reports will say that this individual died at the scene.

There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)",

By concentrating on getting her to do something, and not on trying to be in love for the duration of the scene, the actor will find himself in the world of the concretely doable, not in the nebulous world of feelings outside the actor’s control. The essential action, then, is what exists in the scene when you eliminate all ideas about what you think the author is saying the character feels at any given moment in favor of what he is trying to accomplish. The idea of Lorna dumping Moody for Joe involves all the emotional aspects of a romantic triangle, but what is essential as an end result is one person trying to get another person to take a chance.",

Some of the volunteers had a truly dreadful experience because the shocks they received were quite severe (severe-initiation group), and others had a slightly unpleasant experience because the shocks they received were relatively mild (mild-initiation group). Although you might expect people to dislike anything associated with physical pain, the volunteers in the severe-initiation group actually liked the club more. Because these volunteers suffered greatly, the intensity of their suffering triggered their defensive systems, which immediately began working to help them achieve a credible and positive view of their experience. It isn’t easy to find such a view, but it can be done. For example, physical suffering is bad (“Oh my God, that really hurt!”), but it isn’t entirely bad if the thing one suffers for is extremely valuable (“But I’m joining a very elite group of very special people”). Indeed, research shows that when people are given electric shocks, they actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value. The intense shocks were unpleasant enough to trigger the volunteers’ psychological defenses, but the mild shocks were not, hence the volunteers valued the club most when its initiation was most painful. If you’ve managed to forgive your spouse for some egregious transgression but still find yourself miffed about the dent in the garage door or the trail of dirty socks on the staircase, then you have experienced this paradox.",

But it may have the compensatory effect of keeping more of the Imperfects on the telephone for more of the time, thus increasing the total number of accurate messages they transmit. Under the right circumstances, the costs of this inaccurate belief would be outweighed by its benefits, namely, that it led players to behave in ways that increased the odds that they would share other accurate beliefs. The lesson to be learned from this game is that inaccurate beliefs can prevail in the belief-transmission game if they somehow facilitate their own “means of transmission.” In this case, the means of transmission is not sex but communication, and thus any belief—even a false belief—that increases communication has a good chance of being transmitted over and over again",

The irony, of course, is that surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict one’s future emotions, but because we don’t realize just how similar we all are, we reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as flawed and fallible as they may be.",

First, who says that no one would want to be hooked up? The world is full of people who want happiness and don’t care one bit about whether it is “well deserved.” Second, those who claim that they would not agree to be hooked up may already be hooked up. After all, the deal is that you forget your previous decision. Third, no one can really answer this question because it requires them to imagine a future state in which they do not know the very thing they are currently contemplating. See E. B. Royzman, K. W.

The foreman noted the sexual prowess of his prize rooster: “This rooster can have sex all day without stopping,” he said. “Really?” said Mrs. Coolidge. “Please tell that to my husband.” The president turned to the foreman and asked, “Does the rooster mate with the same chicken each time?” “No,” said the foreman, “always with a different chicken.” To which the president replied, “Really? Please tell that to my wife.” The story is probably apocryphal, but the phenomenon is not: Male mammals who have mated to exhaustion can usually be induced to mate again with a novel female; see J. Wilson, R. Kuehn, and F. Beach, “Modifications in the Sexual Behavior of Male Rats Produced by Changing the Stimulus Female,” Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology 56: 636–44 (1963). In fact, even breeding bulls whose sperm is collected by a machine show a greatly reduced time to ejaculation when the machine to which they’ve become habituated is moved to a novel location. E. B.

The point here is that time and variety are two ways to avoid habituation, and if you have one, then you don’t need the other. In fact (and this is the really critical point, so please put down your fork and listen), when episodes are sufficiently separated in time, variety is not only unnecessary—it can actually be costly.",

    "text": "Galen’s writings were the indisputable source of medical authority for more than a thousand years. “It is I, and I alone, who has revealed the true path of medicine,” Galen wrote with his usual modesty. And yet Galen never conducted anything resembling a modern experiment. Why should he? Experiments are what people do when they aren’t sure what the truth is. And Galen was untroubled by doubt. Each outcome confirmed he was right, no matter how equivocal the evidence might look to someone less wise than the master. “All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time, except those whom it does not help, who all die,” he wrote. “It is obvious, therefore, that it fails only in incurable cases.”5\nGalen is an extreme example but he is the sort of figure who pops up repeatedly in the history of medicine. They are men (always men) of strong conviction and a profound trust in their own judgment. They embrace treatments, develop bold theories for why they work, denounce rivals as quacks and charlatans, and spread their insights with evangelical passion",

His test subjects were “split-brain” patients, meaning that the left and right hemispheres of their brains could not communicate with each other because the connection between them, the corpus callosum, had been surgically severed (traditionally as a treatment for severe epilepsy). These people are remarkably normal, but their condition allows researchers to communicate directly with only one hemisphere of their brain—by showing an image to only the left or right field of vision—without sharing the communication with the other hemisphere. It’s like talking to two different people. In this case, the left field of vision (which reports to the right hemisphere) was shown a picture of a snowstorm and the person was asked to point to the picture that related to it. So he quite reasonably pointed at the shovel. The right field of vision (which reports to the left hemisphere) was shown an image of a chicken claw—and the person was then asked why his hand was pointed at a shovel. The left hemisphere had no idea why. But the person didn’t say “I don’t know.” Instead, he made up a story: “Oh, that’s simple,” one patient said. “The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.”15",

Cost control and performance improvement supersede the old philosophy of development and investment for the public good.

If you fail to act as you’re expected to, others will view your behavior as abnormal, think you arrogant for believing you’re above the rules, or assume you’ve dropped out of society.

He\n\tthen started to apply his theories to the whole cosmos, demonstrating the\n\tharmonic relationship of the stars, planets, and elements. His idea of harmonic\n\trelationships between the stars was eagerly taken up by medieval and Renaissance\n\tastronomers, who developed whole theories around the idea of the music of the\n\tspheres, and his suggestion that the elements were arranged harmoniously was\n\trevisited over 2,000 years after his death. In 1865 English chemist John\n\tNewlands discovered that when the chemical elements are arranged according to\n\tatomic weight, those with similar properties occur at every eighth element, like\n\tnotes of music. This discovery became known as the Law of Octaves, and it helped\n\tlead to the development of the Periodic Law of chemical elements still used\n\ttoday.",

As I see it, there are three.\nTo the first count of not calling you back, you are right, absolutely right. It is rude. It is not how a friend, or even a solid citizen, behaves. I should know better. It sends an unfortunate and incorrect message that I don’t care about you. (If it makes you feel better, I am democratic about this particular failing. I don’t call back my mother, my brother, and my in-laws. My wife says, “Me too.” This is hardly something to brag about—just a minuscule point of honor on my part to assure you that you are not in the bottom half of some imaginary call-back priority list. Apparently, I don’t have one. I treat everyone equally—which is to say, rudely.) For this I apologize to you. And I will change that.\nTo the second count of being a poor host when you were at my house, I certainly did not intend to ignore you or leave you out of the conversation. That said, what I remember is not the point. It’s what you felt that matters, and this is especially pertinent when the issue is hospitality extended or withheld. As Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach used to say about coaching his players, “It’s not what you say, it’s what they hear.” You obviously didn’t enjoy the evening, and for that I apologize. I like to think of myself as a decent and caring and generous host, and I will take your comments as a signal to do better.\nTo the third count of my never initiating a phone call to friends, again you are right, absolutely right. Some people, as you say, like to work at friendship. Others don’t.\nOf all the charges you level at me, the third is the one that pains me most—because it is true and because it is so easily fixed. You are not the first to point this out. I guess I could wander back into my childhood to figure out why I act this way, but looking backward, seeking out scapegoats, is a fool’s errand. I’m 52 years old. I can’t blame my mother or my upbringing or that lousy tuna sandwich in third grade. All I can do is promise to fix my behavior, one step at a time—by taking my cues from you, by doing the things you say a good friend does. Hopefully, my rehabilitation starts with you.\nThe evidence notwithstanding, I do value our friendship. Tremendously. We have too many years of laughs and good times and neighboring and genuine caring for each other to let our friendship slip away because I am a schmuck in an area where you least value that kind of behavior. All I can ask is your forgiveness. If you can grant me that, I do not expect us to return to things the way they were. I think we should aim higher. I would want us to return to things as they should be, where I can aspire to the ideal of friendship that you have described in your honest, painfully honest, letter to me.\nShall we discuss this over a bottle of red?",

In fact, I calculate that you have to get 100% better in order to get 10% credit for it from your coworkers.”\nThe logic behind this is, as I’ve explained in Chapter 3, cognitive dissonance: To recap, we view people in a manner that is consistent with our previous existing stereotypes, whether it is positive or negative. If I think you’re an arrogant jerk, everything you do will be filtered through that perception. If you do something wonderful and saintly, I will regard it as the exception to the rule; you’re still an arrogant jerk. Within that framework it’s almost impossible for us to be perceived as improving, no matter how hard we try.\nHowever, the odds improve considerably if you tell people that you are trying to change. Suddenly, your efforts are on their radar screen. You’re beginning to chip away at their preconceptions.\nYour odds improve again if you tell everyone how hard you’re trying, and repeat the message week after week.\nYour odds improve even more if you ask everyone for ideas to help you get better.

You committed “one, two, three, seven.”\nYou failed to appreciate that every successful project goes through seven phases: The first is assessing the situation; the second is isolating the problem; the third is formulating. But there are three more phases before you get to the seventh, implementation.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people don’t pay close attention to phases four, five, and six—the vital period when you approach your coworkers to secure the all-important political buy-in to your plans. In each phase you must target a different constituency. In phase 4, you woo up—to get your superiors to approve. In phase 5, you woo laterally—to get your peers to agree. In phase 6, you woo down—to get your direct reports to accept. These three phases are the sine qua non of getting things done. You cannot skip or skim over them. You have to give them as much, if not more, attention, as you do phases one, two, three, and seven. If you don’t, you may as well be working alone in a locked room where no one sees you, hears you, or knows you exist. That’s the guaranteed result of committing “one, two, three, seven.”",

For sheer drama, apologizing fits the bill. What could be more theatrical than telling people that you’re sorry for some transgression and you’ll try to do better in the future, especially people who think you cannot change?\nDon’t stop there. You can’t just apologize and say you’re trying to do better just once. You have to drill it into people repeatedly, until they’ve internalized the concept.\nIt’s the reason politicians in a hard election campaign run the same ads over and over again.

As I hope I made clear in my brief history of feedback in Chapter 6, feedback has its virtues. It’s a great tool for determining what happened in the past and what’s going on in an organization. It’s no different than reading history, which teaches us how we all arrived here right now in this moment.

Just as there are words that are best left unspoken, so there are feelings that are best left unthought.* The theory is that if all our unconscious motivations were to impinge on our consciousness, subtle cues in our behaviour might reveal our true motivation, which would limit our social and reproductive prospects.\nRobert Trivers gives an extraordinary example of a case where an animal having conscious access to its own actions may be damaging to its evolutionary fitness. When a hare is being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random and not conscious, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer.",

Buckshot, a large size of lead shot used in hunting game, dates from the early days of firearms and has been so called since about 1400. One writer suggests it gave rise to pass the buck -- that is, to shift responsibility or blame someone else -- from a counter consisting of a piece of buckshot put in front of the dealer in a poker game and passing it on to the next person who was to deal. Another source suggests the object so passed originally was a buckhorn, a type of knife so named because its handle was made from a buck's antlers. Whichever is true, the term originated in the United States in the latter half of the 19th century and was made famous after 1949 by President Harry S Truman, who kept a sign on his desk in the White House that said, \"The buck stops here\" (that is, I'll take full responsibility).",

From this came, in the 16th century or even earlier, bearskin jobber, a broker who gambled on his belief that the market would fall (prices would drop) and behaved accordingly (sold his holdings while he could still get a high price). This term was easily shortened to bear. The bear's counterpart, the bull, believes prices are going to rise and therefore buys while they are still low. The source for this kind of bull is less clear. Some believe it comes from the bull's tossing objects up with his horns; others believe that bull-baiting was more or less a companion sport to bear-baiting. Whichever the case, both the concept and the terms have stuck, and we still speak of a bullish or bearish investor, described as optimistic or pessimistic respectively, and a bull market or bear market, depending on which type of investor prevails.",

In one, the nightingale (or sparrow, depending on the translation) tries to talk its captor, the hawk, into letting it go, since it is but a small morsel, and to search for bigger prey. But the hawk knows better. In another, a fisherman catches an anchovy that argues along the same lines as the nightingale. The proverb originated in Greek, was repeated in Latin -- it appeared in Britain in Latin Medieval Proverbs (c. 1400) as a rhymed verse -- and by 1450 or so had an English version. Today it is often put: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Similar sayings appear in Italian (better an egg today than a chicken tomorrow), German (one bird in the hand is better than ten flying over the land), French (better a sparrow than a goose in the air), Spanish (a bird in the hand is better than a hundred flying), and other languages.",

As the adult strained to pull the toy apart, he let his hand slip off one end. He tried again, but this time let his hand slip off the other end. The adult’s intention was clear: he wanted to pull the toy apart. But apparently he failed.\nAfter the adult’s performance, the researcher presented the object to the infants and observed what they did. The babies would pick up the dumbbell and immediately pull it apart—forty out of the fifty times the experiment was conducted. They didn’t mimic what the adults did; they imitated what they thought the adults wanted to do. They read beneath the surface behavior.\nThe babies in the experiment were pre-linguistic.

They add up to a distinctively human model of reality, which differs in major ways from the objective understanding of reality eked out by our best science and logic. Though these ideas are woven into language, their roots are deeper than language itself. They lay out the ground rules for how we understand our surroundings, how we assign credit and blame to our fellows, and how we negotiate our relationships with them.

    "text": "In The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins explains how sexual selection can produce flamboyant displays like the outsize tail of a widowbird. Traits in males that are attractive to females can vary wildly over the course of evolution, Dawkins notes, because there are many stable combinations of a tail length preferred by females and an actual tail length in the population (which is itself a compromise between the length preferred by previous generations of choosy females and the length that is optimal for flight). Mathematicians call this “a line of equilibria,” and to establish the conditions that produce it they require abstruse equations. But Dawkins explains the idea as follows:\n\t\n\t\n\tSuppose that a room has both a heating device and a cooling device, each with its own thermostat. Both thermostats are set to keep the room at the same fixed temperature, 70 degrees F. If the temperature drops below 70, the heater turns itself on and the refrigerator turns itself off. If the temperature rises above 70, the refrigerator turns itself on and the heater turns itself off. The analogue of the widow bird’s tail length is not the temperature (which remains constant at 70°) but the total rate of consumption of electricity. The point is that there are lots of different ways in which the desired temperature can be achieved. It can be achieved by both devices working very hard, the heater belting out hot air and the refrigerator working flat out to neutralize the heat. Or it can be achieved by the heater putting out a bit less heat, and the cooler working correspondingly less hard to neutralize it. Or it can be achieved by both devices working scarcely at all. Obviously, the latter is the more desirable solution from the point of view of the electricity bill but, as far as the object of maintaining the fixed temperature is concerned, every one of a large series of working rates is equally satisfactory . We have a line of equilibrium points, rather than a single point.",

The predominant strategy was the ornate euphemism—an effort to divert attention from the true horrors of death and destruction by labeling something the opposite of what it truly was. An aggressive attack by an armada of airplanes, which most speakers of English call simply an air raid, was instead spoken of as a momentary defensive strategy, a routine limited duration protective reaction. Defoliation of an entire forest, with the result that it may not sprout another green leaf for decades or even hundreds of years, was labeled a resources control program. The thirty-four dollars given to families of South Vietnamese civilians killed by mistake were called condolence awards, and bombing errors against friendly villages were termed navigation misdirection. Starving and homeless Vietnamese, fleeing from the horrors of war, did not seek survival in a refugee camp but instead discovered freshening experiences in what the Pentagon dubbed a new life hamlet or an Open Arms camp. A further strategy was the creation of a whole new set of “before” and “after” terms which bestowed tremendous dignity upon minor military objectives, but only after they had been destroyed. What before had been simply a straw-thatched hut became, after its bombardment, a structure. A sunken one-man dugout was elevated to a vessel, and a splintered set of logs thrown across a stream became a bridge; a gimcrack bomb-shelter, once destroyed, was referred to as a bunker or a network of tunnels.",

The scientific name for both sexes of our species is the word for only one of them, Homo, “man” in Latin; our species is also referred to as human (derived from Homo) or mankind, two other words which similarly serve to make women invisible. The average person is always masculine (as in the man in the street) and so is the hypothetical person in riddles and in examination questions (If a man can walk ten miles in seven minutes, how many miles can he walk in twelve minutes?). The word he is often used as a common-gender pronoun, even though it is possible that a female is being referred to (as in When the vice-president of the company came to town, he…). If the antecedent is a high-prestige occupational role—such as vice-president, manager, doctor, director, and so forth—then the pronoun is very likely to be he, whereas if the antecedent is a secretary, nurse, or elementary-school teacher, the pronoun is apt to be she. In discussions among college faculty (usually a “he” word), students who cheat are often referred to as he and students who do not as she. The English language is riddled with other examples of conceptual categories which apply to one sex or the other. Males roar, bellow, and growl; females squeal, shriek, and purr",

The inability to set aside something that you know but that someone else does not know is such a pervasive affliction of the human mind that psychologists keep discovering related versions of it and giving it new names. There is egocentrism, the inability of children to imagine a simple scene, such as three toy mountains on a tabletop, from another person’s vantage point. There’s hindsight bias, the tendency of people to think that an outcome they happen to know, such as the confirmation of a disease diagnosis or the outcome of a war, should have been obvious to someone who had to make a prediction about it before the fact. There’s false consensus, in which people who make a touchy personal decision (like agreeing to help an experimenter by wearing a sandwich board around campus with the word REPENT) assume that everyone else would make the same decision. There’s illusory transparency, in which observers who privately know the backstory to a conversation and thus can tell that a speaker is being sarcastic assume that the speaker’s naïve listeners can somehow detect the sarcasm, too. And there’s mindblindness, a failure to mentalize, or a lack of a theory of mind, in which a three-year-old who sees a toy being hidden while a second child is out of the room assumes that the other child will look for it in its actual location rather than where she last saw it.",

First, it ensures that writers will get their messages across, sparing readers from squandering their precious moments on earth deciphering opaque prose. When the effort fails, the result can be calamitous—as Strunk and White put it, “death on the highway caused by a badly worded road sign, heartbreak among lovers caused by a misplaced phrase in a well-intentioned letter, anguish of a traveler expecting to be met at a railroad station and not being met because of a slipshod telegram.” Governments and corporations have found that small improvements in clarity can prevent vast amounts of error, frustration, and waste, and many countries have recently made clear language the law of the land.\n\tSecond, style earns trust. If readers can see that a writer cares about consistency and accuracy in her prose, they will be reassured that the writer cares about those virtues in conduct they cannot see as easily. Here is how one technology executive explains why he rejects job applications filled with errors of grammar and punctuation: “If it takes someone more than 20 years to notice how to properly use it’s, then that’s not a learning curve I’m comfortable with.”11 And if that isn’t enough to get you to brush up your prose, consider the discovery of the dating site OkCupid that sloppy grammar and spelling in a profile are “huge turn-offs.” As one client said, “If you’re trying to date a woman, I don’t expect flowery Jane Austen prose. But aren’t you trying to put your best foot forward?”12\n\tStyle, not least, adds beauty to the world. To a literate reader, a crisp sentence, an arresting metaphor, a witty aside, an elegant turn of phrase are among life’s greatest pleasures. And as we shall see in the first chapter, this thoroughly impractical virtue of good writing is where the practical effort of mastering good writing must begin",

The most obvious is that a negative statement such as The king is not dead is harder on the reader than an affirmative one like The king is alive. Every negation requires mental homework, and when a sentence contains many of them the reader can be overwhelmed. Even worse, a sentence can have more negations than you think it does. Not all negation words begin with n; many have the concept of negation tucked inside them, such as few, little, least, seldom, though, rarely, instead, doubt, deny, refute, avoid, and ignore.",

Starting in 2019, for example, Google began adding “Order Online” buttons to restaurant listings. It should have been an added convenience for everyone involved, but Google deliberately cut the restaurants out, partnering with companies like GrubHub, DoorDash, and Postmates to bypass individual, restaurant-owned delivery platforms. It’s been incredibly lucrative for Google, which gets a reported 10 percent cut of orders placed through the button, and incredibly frustrating for restaurant owners, who say there’s no easy way to opt out of a cut-rate service they never even signed up for. The affected restaurants can either sit back and watch up to 40 percent of their profits get eaten up in delivery platform fees or essentially stop offering takeout altogether. Even if they’re still offering to-go meals, the sad truth is that they might as well not exist if they’re not indexed on Google.

His subjects had no problem picking out the correct line—until they were put in a room of actors who deliberately chose one of the incorrect answers.

Elliot was a successful guy: he had a great job, a loving family, and he was a role model at work and at home. Unfortunately, Elliot also had a brain tumor. Tests revealed that, thankfully, it was benign, and a team of skilled surgeons were able to remove every smidge of it, but not before it had damaged some of his frontal lobe tissue, which was also removed. He recovered from the operation, and on the outside appeared to be hale and hearty. But on the inside, Elliot was no longer himself.\n\tHis life began to fall apart. He lost his job and his family, he embarked on questionable endeavors that made no sense and ended disastrously, he lost what money he had to con men, and he was finally taken in by his parents.\n\tWhat happened? Was it a previously undetected failure of moral character? Was he just lazy? That’s what several professionals thought, and so his disability benefits were cut off.\n\tThat’s when Damasio was brought in to answer the question: was Elliot’s behavior willful, or was it part of an underlying medical condition? Damasio ran a large battery of tests, and what he ultimately discovered was that Elliot had lost the ability to feel emotion. His “objective” knowledge, however, had not suffered at all.\n\tHe still tested in the ninety-seventh percentile in intelligence. He could enumerate, in great detail, every possible solution to any problem you could pitch at him. He just couldn’t pick one. He’d go into his office and wonder, should I do that thing my boss really wants me to do, or should I reorganize my file folders again today? And if so, would it be better to use the blue pen or the black pen? At lunch he’d go from restaurant to restaurant looking at menus, but he never went in, because he didn’t know what he felt like eating.

So, what was?\n\tGreenfield turned to the young boy who’d thrown “like a girl” by dropping the ball. “So, do you think you just insulted your sister?” she asked.\n\tHe looked shocked, as if the thought never occurred to him. “No,” he said and then stopped short, “I mean yeah, insulting girls, but not my sister.” And then the penny dropped; you can see it in his eyes. His sister is a girl. If he’s insulting girls, then…uh oh.\n\tThe beauty of it is that, in asking that question, Greenfield wasn’t vilifying the boy; she was vilifying the belief—a very different thing. It allowed him to look at it without feeling that she was shaming him and to see it for what it is: wrong. Any shame he might have felt came from his own realization, rather than anything she said to him.",

Sea turtles plan their reproductive cycle to coincide with just the right temperature window within which to lay their eggs.

The female learns whether the male really controls the shelter or if another male can come kick him out. More than anything, a female lobster needs to know her partner can offer her total protection when it comes time to mate. For the male, it’s a chance for him to learn if she is really ripe and ready—something he can likely smell and taste.

For years I’ve painted her in tortured forms, not through sadism, not through pleasure, either; just obeying a vision that forced itself on me. It was the deep reality, not the superficial one.”11 During one of Maar’s early encounters with Picasso, he watched her play the knife game at a café, repeatedly stabbing the spaces between her splayed fingers. Inevitably she missed, cut herself, and bled. As the story goes, Picasso asked for the gloves she had removed and displayed them in a vitrine in his apartment. In 1936, he drew Maar as a beautiful harpy, her head on a bird’s body. Picasso’s biographers have cast their subject’s misogyny and sadism in various lights, but none of them doubts that his fear, cruelty, and ambivalence found their way onto his canvases. Perhaps this was most succinctly stated by Angela Carter: “Picasso liked cutting up women.”12\nThe tearful woman with her weapon-like fingernails clearly has multiple dream-like associations: war, grief, sadistic pleasure. They are all there in the weeping woman.\nIdeas become part of our perceptions, but we are not always conscious of them.\nThe story of art is continually being revised by art movements, by money and collectors, by “definitive” museum shows, by new concerns, discoveries, and ideologies that alter the telling of the past.

Wilson, to write a seminal article in the Atlantic Monthly on so-called broken-windows policing. The idea was that low-level crimes and misdemeanors created an atmosphere of disorder in a neighborhood. This scared law-abiding citizens away. The dark and empty streets they left behind were breeding grounds for serious crime. The antidote was for society to resist the spread of disorder.

Instead, she is going to find out what her misbelief has cost her.\n\tWhile Dorothy’s external goal is to go home, her real problem is that she doesn’t believe she has the power to solve her problem, so instead of standing up for what she believes in, she runs. Not because she’s weak or lacks courage, but because that’s what, up to that moment, life has taught her the right course of action is.
